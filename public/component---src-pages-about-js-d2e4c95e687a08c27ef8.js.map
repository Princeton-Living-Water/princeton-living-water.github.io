Through His Word, God created mankind through Adam and Eve, giving mankind all they needed, and\n          He was together with them. However, through the disobedient choice of Adam and Eve, sin entered the world, and\n          we were separated from God. Because we were created to be with God, by being separated from Him, we were all\n          dead in our sins.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          However, God, in His infinite love and grace, chose to send His Son, Jesus, who was God, to the world to live\n          a perfect life as a man and to die on the cross for sinnersâ€™ sakes. In this way, He who had never sinned took\n          on the consequences of sin, so that we may be considered righteous before God to be once again united with\n          Him. Jesus resurrected on the third day and in Him we have the hope of our own resurrection and a life eternal\n          with God when Jesus comes back one day.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          We believe that Christianity is more than following a set of actions or rules, but having a relationship with\n          the LORD God. This relationship is available for those who accept and receive His grace through the belief in\n          Jesus Christ as our lord and savior, and they will be called the sons and daughters of the living God of the\n          universe.\n        </p>\n        <hr />\n        <a href=\"/faq\">\n          <h3>frequently asked questions</h3>\n        </a>\n      </Subpage>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nimport logo from \"../assets/img/logo.png\";\n\nimport \"../assets/styles.css\";\n\nconst Subpage = ({ children }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"subpage\">\n      <a href=\"/\" className=\"title\">\n        <img src={logo} alt=\"Living Water\" className=\"logo\" />\n        <h1>Living Water</h1>\n      </a>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nSubpage.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n};\n\nexport default Subpage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/logo-aa9e77d2d33a77bc2316a7b722d7aa20.png\";","const addCollapsible = () => {\n  var coll = document.getElementsByClassName(\"collapsible\");\n  var i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < coll.length; i++) {\n    coll[i].addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      this.classList.toggle(\"active\");\n      var content = this.nextElementSibling;\n      if (content.style.display === \"block\") {\n        content.style.display = \"none\";\n      } else {\n        content.style.display = \"block\";\n      }\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default addCollapsible;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
