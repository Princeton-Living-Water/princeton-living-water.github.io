          <li>for those receiving the easter email to have open hearts to the Gospel</li>
          <li>for those Christians who disagree with living water emails to understand our urgent heart for sharing the Gospel and to fear God over man</li>
          <li>(personal) for my brother nathan (junior in college) because he's pretty cynical, kinda seems like he believes in his own logic over truth & authority of God's Word, during family bible study he got into a conflict over theological diff. and it was rlly hard for me bc ive been praying for him for years and idk man would rlly appreciate prayer for him to really understand the beauty and truth of the Gospel (he "knows" it all, but i don't see any true transformation)</li>

          <li>Time management. This is the first time in life where I’m trying to put God like acc first and sometimes I feel like David in Psalm 73, like is it worth the time? Which I know it is but orgo...</li>
          <li>To trust God with my time and let Him direct my schedule and classes. Recently gave my academics over to God. So just seeking him to pull me through and teach me to manage my time</li>
          <li>Direction. I get a lot of ideas and visions for how God may want to use me. But daily direction from him concerning kingdom work stuff (like blog writing, posting on insta, reading stuff, talking to people 1-1). This also goes with time management cuz I need time to do these things</li>
          <li>Pray Proverbs 3:5-6 over me. Overall, I need to trust God with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding and acknowledge him in all my ways so that he will make my path straight</li>
