          <li>father and family</li>
          <li>future plans</li>
          <li>continued strength in ministry for the Lord</li>

        <ul>
          <li>For a high school friend I'm inviting to Manna's Friends Night (invite people!). I haven't talked to him in very long, and we honestly aren't too close. I've changed a lot too.
          I'm really trusting in God for this. It seems awkward and out of the blue for me to ask, but pray that he will come so that we can talk about God more.</li>
          <li>For the next 5 months - that God would prepare me for leading Living Water. Ask God to do whatever it takes for me to grow in character and wisdom.
          Not just me, but these next 5 months are critical for all of us!</li>
          <li>I'm better at working than loving. I find that I do not think about of love my close friends enough, much less my campus. Ask God to teach me love -
          I want to evanglize in Christ and out of love. Ask God that everything I do stems from the Gospel and nothing else (1 Corinthinas 3:10-15).</li>
          <li>I've been busy and life has been non-stop (though enjoyable) - ask God that I don't ever forget the sufficiency of Christ or fall under the illusion that
          somehow God is reliant on Living Water or my works. Ask God that while I work and in my work, Christ will always be my eternal rest. (Hebrews 4)</li>

        <ul>
          <li>for those receiving the easter email to have open hearts to the Gospel</li>
          <li>for those Christians who disagree with living water emails to understand our urgent heart for sharing the Gospel and to fear God over man</li>
          <li>(personal) for my brother nathan (junior in college) because he's pretty cynical, kinda seems like he believes in his own logic over truth & authority of God's Word, during family bible study he got into a conflict over theological diff. and it was rlly hard for me bc ive been praying for him for years and idk man would rlly appreciate prayer for him to really understand the beauty and truth of the Gospel (he "knows" it all, but i don't see any true transformation)</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Christians who are falling away from the faith since they have no conviction or brokenness over their sin.</li>
          <li>Christians or others who can’t come to terms with parts of scripture.</li>

          <li>I just want to pass all my classes. Orgo is crushing me right now, and I just need help</li>
          <li>Time management. This is the first time in life where I’m trying to put God like acc first and sometimes I feel like David in Psalm 73, like is it worth the time? Which I know it is but orgo...</li>
          <li>To trust God with my time and let Him direct my schedule and classes. Recently gave my academics over to God. So just seeking him to pull me through and teach me to manage my time</li>
          <li>Direction. I get a lot of ideas and visions for how God may want to use me. But daily direction from him concerning kingdom work stuff (like blog writing, posting on insta, reading stuff, talking to people 1-1). This also goes with time management cuz I need time to do these things</li>
          <li>Pray Proverbs 3:5-6 over me. Overall, I need to trust God with all my heart and lean not on my own understanding and acknowledge him in all my ways so that he will make my path straight</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Pray daily! We must all seek God more. Pray and be invested in each other. As we strive to love Princeton, let's embody
          a loving body amongst ourselves with the unity we have in Christ. Let's be intentional in talking with one another,
          rejoicing/weeping with one another, and keeping one another accountable - that we are praying and reading the Bible and not wasting the time God has given us
          (it might feel awkawrd but I'm saying it now so that you don't have to worry about the other person thinking you are
          annoying - trust me, I'd appreciate if you guys pester me about whether I'm really seeking after God.)</li>
          <li>Read Handa's <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHW23ggG2sru4c4qPud2o9BXOFzRETr6MkW1LZxFVsQ/edit">Problem of Evil paper</a> (by end of Tuesday). Offer suggestions and talk about it in the chat.</li>
          <li>Update the FAQ (add Problem of Evil and finish addressing slavery).</li>
          <li>Prayerfully talk to people that you think should share their testimony in our weekly emails!</li>
          <li>(For Joe) Organize this week's Hand Sanitizer outreach.</li>
          <li>(For Handa/Joe) Incorporate Living Water as a non-profit in NJ and open up a bank account.</li>
          <li>(For a volunteer to take charge) Make a interest form for people who are willing to share testimonies in our emails. Send it to BaWP afterwards.
          You'll be in charge of coordinating it with the bigger LW chat.</li>
          <li>Use your creative minds to medidate on Living Water.
            What else can we do? How can we improve and prepare for next year?
            Are we pleasing to Christ? Let's talk it out in BaWP.</li>
          <li>5 For this very reason, <strong>make every effort</strong> to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 7 and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. 8 For if you possess these qualities in <strong>increasing measure</strong>, they will <strong>keep you from being ineffective and unproductive</strong> in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
