1 John 2:26-27: Anointing

June 7, 2020


26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.


*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***



By the “anointing”, we know that John is talking about the receiving of the Holy Spirit. This is the same image as that which is alluded to in 1 Samuel 16 when David is anointed king and the Holy Spirit rushes upon him. David was anointed by Samuel with oil and then in a rush as if a wind not unlike that of Acts 2, the Holy Spirit descended upon David to remain with him in perpetuity.


This Spirit given to the greatest king of Israel is the same Spirit that lives inside all who call upon the name of Jesus as King of their hearts. This same Spirit that taught David the myriad of poetry and songs is the same Spirit that makes us to sing hymns of praise. Finally, as John points out in today’s passage, this same Spirit of God speaks and teaches the believers “about everything” that they should know to “abide in him” (verse 27).


Now, before going any further, we must be assured that John is not making a case against teachers in general. For as we have studied in Ephesians, teachers are one of the gifts of God to men (Ephesians 4:11). We must not mistakenly conclude from this passage that we are to rid ourselves of all human teachers to be reliant only on the Spirit to reveal and to expound the Scripture in all its magnificence and coherence.


No, rather, John is meaning to say that there is no additional knowledge or special teaching that is needed for the Church to understand Scripture — we are sufficiently adorned with the revelatory scope of the Spirit to understand the Word that is made clear to us. We understand without a special knowledge what God’s Good News is if we have the Spirit within us. Again, John is not saying that the support systems God instituted in the form of pastors, teachers, and fellow brethren are not important, but that they are additional assistance to what is the sufficient working of the Spirit. To forget that the Spirit works in these fellow believers to evoke metamorphosis within us would be foolishness.


Instead of making such general statements such as, “I only need the Holy Spirit to exposit Scripture. To use other aids is heretical according to this letter!”, we need to read these verses in context!


What has John been protecting the faith of the recipients of this letter from? The antichrists — those who are denying the orthodox incarnation of Christ. We learned earlier that these people would come to be called the “docetists” or in general, “gnostics”. They believed that a special knowledge and revelation was to be received by believers if they were to “follow God properly”. To this, John is responding, “Rubbish!”. The Christian has already received the sufficiency of divine indwelling. They do not need some special knowledge that the man must procure and comprehend within the confines of the limited human mind, but the believer, rather, is in communion and in perfect communication with God who is omniscient. Once again, as in the Garden, man receives all he needs from God directly.


John wants to protect the believers from evil men who are “trying to deceive” them (verse 26). To protect ourselves from such deception, we must first realize that the anointing abides in us, that we have no need apart from God to abide in Him, and that all we receive from Him is true (verse 27).


In these troubling times, the antichrists will attack. There are plenty of evil men out there who are seeking to take advantage of people troubled by the circumstances of this world. They peddle their “methods” for procuring the “prosperity” of God. I received such a postcard in the mail today! Some even use the events to push for a reform of the kingdom of this earth while never once having had the heart to serve the Kingdom of God.


The devil will take advantage of troubles to make us to focus on the troubles in and of themselves so as to shift our gaze away from heaven down to earth. This may come in the form of prosperity gospel, and it may come in the form of enticing the believers to be angry about the injustices committed against men while making us to not even notice the evil committed towards God in our acts of disdainful worship.


It is at this time that we must rely on the Spirit to teach us what to do rather than what the popular causes of the world allure us to.


Consider


1. Do we receive the teaching of the Spirit daily?

2. Do we substitute God’s Kingdom for this worldly kingdom?
