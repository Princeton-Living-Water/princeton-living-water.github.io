*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***


Now, the list that we just read are not just names but also towns and cities in Israel. Verses 3 to 20 cover the families as named by the patriarch of the line, and verses 21 to 35 enumerate the people of their ancestral homes.


These show that the Israelites had not forgotten and that they had not lost their hope in God who promised that He would be with them. They remembered the faithfulness of God and His steadfast love through the stories of their fathers, and they held dear to their inheritance of the promised land by remembering their hometowns.


These men listed in our passage today are not special men. In fact, most of the thousands of men who came are not even listed— only their fathers are listed. Furthermore, even most of the fathers are not men of significance in other parts of the Bible. Majority of them were most likely farmers, merchants, butchers, and craftsmen. They were men who had had to do whatever it took to survive in the land of Babylon where they were exiled to. Some of them may have even had to serve under the very leaders and oppressors who had taken away their home and inheritance.


These were not men to be remembered, yet God remembered them.


You see, these men are listed before even the priests and the Levites who served the LORD directly in the temple. They were listed before the most sacred people of the nation of Israel. Yet, it was not because they were of a certain special distinction; we have already made that clear— they were laymen. 


No, they are listed first because they were the ordinary people who held fast to the LORD when all hope seemed to have been lost. They are listed first because these were the men who raised up their children and protected their wives from the evil cultures of Babylon. They are recognized by the LORD because they were the remnant who held fast to the faith enough to pack up their entire lives in Babylon, where they had remained for 70 years, because they were broken by the idea that while they lived in paneled houses, the house of LORD lay in the rubbles. They, though they were not appointed to the service of the LORD as were the Levites, had a stirred spirit that desired to glorify the LORD through the raising of the temple and through it, the raising of Israel.


Some of these “sons” are from cities like Bethel, Ai, and Jericho. They are from towns that testify of the mighty hand of God in procuring and establishing the nation of Israel. And perhaps, that is what these men remembered. Perhaps it was the story of God appearing to Jacob at Bethel that provoked them to their feet, or perhaps it was the story of Joshua and the men being redeemed at Ai that brought tears to their eyes, or perhaps it was the story of the trumpets at Jericho when the wall came tumbling down that made the men to feel the thumping of their own hearts at the idea of their homeland. Whatever it was that reminded them, one thing is clear. These ordinary men were used by God in the spectacular task of building up the very house of God.


Most of us will not be called to pastorship. Most of us will never stand at the pulpit and deliver a winsome sermon that resonates the truth of the Gospel deeply within the hearts of the congregants. Most of us will not write commentaries or books on theology. However, all of us, all of the Church of the living God, are called to a mission of building up the house of God.


This house of God lives within us. His name we all know as Jesus. Just as the house of the LORD was the house of the LORD because God chose to dwell in it, our hearts are the dwelling places of God because God chooses to live in us. If so, we ought to remember as these men remembered. We ought to seek the glory of God as these men remembered. They had laid down all their livelihood in Babylon to seek God.


Won’t you lay down all to seek God as we ought to?


Jesus asked the believers to take up their cross and follow Him (Matthew 16:24), are you doing this daily?


Consider

1. How have you remembered God’s goodness today?
2. How will you remind yourself of God and deepen your relationship with Him?
