        <p>
          Handa is just a dude trying to share the Gospel.<br>
          Handa first started Living Water in his junior year when he decided to buy some water bottle to hand out to people on the Street so that he can share the Gospel. He wasn&apos;t being original or anything -- he copied the idea from his friend from Cambridge, England. Since then, Living Water has grown and does a bit more than that. He&apos;s excited to see how much more God will use it for His Kingdom work.

        <p>
          God taught Joe a simple but awesome truth as a freshman: without Christ, he has nothing, yet with Christ there is joy in everything! It took Joe a while to realize what that meant, but God convinced him that it was true. Filled and overflowing with joy, Joe joined Living Water because the he wants everyone to know Gospel is so worth it.

        <p>
          I used to shy away from evangelizing because I was ashamed of the Gospel. However, after God revealed to me how amazing and life-changing His Good News is, I couldn&apos;t help but feel an urgency to share with those close to me on campus. I joined Living Water on its first day, Dean&apos;s Date 2020, to point others to Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.

          Fisayo&apos;s first week at Living Water, she was surprised to encounter people curious enough to have a conversation about Jesus in the freezing cold! The harvest is surely ready, and God just needs more laborers. She wants to be one of them.
