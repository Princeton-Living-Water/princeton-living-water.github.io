      <p class="content">
        God is loving and He is just.
        God created all things and is the sustainer of life.
        God is holy and perfect.
        God is sovereign and in control of all things.
        God is infinite, eternal, and unchanging.

      <a class="collapsible"><h3> why do I have to believe? </h3></a>
      <p class="content">
        We have to believe because we were originally created to believe in God
        and to live in union with God.
        We have all seen suffering and trouble that seem to point to how the
        world is broken. When we view this broken world, we come to wonder why
        it is so, and think if there may be something better. Christians believe
        that people have this kind of mindset, and a desire to seek something
        better, because truly, we were created to be somewhere better, and to be
        with someone better. We believe that the world was created to be in
        paradise, and to be with God. We, all of humanity, must believe, because
        that was what we were originally created for — we will not be
        accomplishing our primary objective if we do not worship Him who created
        us because that was what we were created for. God is glorified when we
        are satisfied in Him.

      <a class="collapsible"><h3> why can’t everyone just be saved? </h3></a>
      <p class="content">
        We believe in a God who is good and just. As such, God cannot just
        turn a blind eye to our sin and disobedience. Our sinful nature
        separates us from God: because He is perfect in all ways and we are not,
        our sin prevents us from being accepted by God. The just punishment for
        our rebellion against God is an eternity of separation from God after
        death. This is where the need to be saved comes in: the good news is
        that God made a way for us to be saved through his Son Jesus. However,
        an important step in being saved is to recognize the need for a savior,
        but unfortunately in today’s world, many people do not acknowledge this.
        God loves all of us, even if we reject Him, and because of this,
        He gives us a choice and does not force us into his presence. Salvation
        is a free gift for those who recognize their helplessness due to sin and
        trust in Jesus as the only one who can save.
