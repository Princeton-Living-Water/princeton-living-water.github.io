      <a class="collapsible"><h3> what is Christianity/the Gospel? &#9660;</h3></a>
      <p class="content">
Christianity is the belief and worship of the God of the Bible.<br><br>
        We believe in a God who is perfect in every way who created the world to glorify Himself and for His creation to enjoy Him. Through His Word, God created mankind through Adam and Eve, giving mankind all they needed, and He was together with them. However, through the disobedient choice of Adam and Eve, sin entered the world, and we were separated from God. Because we were created to be with God, by being separated from Him, we were all dead in our sins.<br><br>
        However, God, in His infinite love and grace, chose to send His Son, Jesus, who was God, to the world to live a perfect life as a man and to die on the cross for sinners’ sakes. In this way, He who had never sinned took on the consequences of sin, so that we may be considered righteous before God to be once again united with Him. Jesus resurrected on the third day and in Him we have the hope of our own resurrection and a life eternal with God when Jesus comes back one day.<br><br>
        We believe that Christianity is more than following a set of actions or rules, but having a relationship with the LORD God. This relationship is available for those who accept and receive His grace through the belief in Jesus Christ as our lord and savior, and they will be called the sons and daughters of the living God of the universe.

      <div class="content">
        <p>God is loving and He is just. God is holy and perfect.</p>
        <p>God created all things and is the sustainer of life. God is sovereign
          and in control of all things.</p>
        <p>God is infinite, eternal, and unchanging.</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3> why do I have to believe? &#9660;</h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p> We have to believe because we were originally created to believe in God
        and to live in union with God.</p>

        <p>We have all seen suffering and trouble that seem to point to how the
        world is broken. When we view this broken world, we come to wonder why
        it is so, and think if there may be something better. Christians believe
        that people have this kind of mindset, and a desire to seek something
        better, because truly, we were created to be somewhere better, and to be
        with someone better. We believe that the world was created to be in
        paradise, and to be with God.</p>
        <p>We, all of humanity, must believe, because
        that was what we were originally created for — we will not be
        accomplishing our primary objective if we do not worship Him who created
        us because that was what we were created for. God is glorified when we
        are satisfied in Him.</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3> why can’t everyone just be saved? &#9660;</h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We believe in a God who is good and just. As such, God cannot just
        turn a blind eye to our sin and disobedience. Our sinful nature
        separates us from God: because He is perfect in all ways and we are not,
        our sin prevents us from being accepted by God. The just punishment for
        our rebellion against God is an eternity of separation from God after
        death.</p>
        <p>This is where the need to be saved comes in: the good news is
        that God made a way for us to be saved through his Son Jesus. However,
        an important step in being saved is to recognize the need for a savior,
        but unfortunately in today’s world, many people do not acknowledge this.
        God loves all of us, even if we reject Him, and because of this,
        He gives us a choice and does not force us into his presence. Salvation
        is a free gift for those who recognize their helplessness due to sin and
        trust in Jesus as the only one who can save.</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3>  how do I know Christianity is true? &#9660;</h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Whether we realize it or not, we all hold unprovable basic beliefs
        that are ingrained within our psychology:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beliefs about the universe (you exist, life has meaning, cause and effect exists)</li>
          <li>Beliefs about knowledge (logic is reliable, memory is reliable, your senses are reliable)</li>
          <li>Beliefs about ethics (human beings have value, Love and Justice are real)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These beliefs are presuppositions and the foundation upon which we form
        all other beliefs. Humans have different models for where we derive
        these beliefs from. They help us figure out what is True. These models
        explain who we are and what our purpose is. Some models Princetonians
        follow are secular humanism or naturalism.</p>
        <p> Christians believe in the
        model of Christianity. Christians believe that our basic beliefs are a
        result of us being made in the likeness of our Creator God. As a result,
        these beliefs come from a God-given conscience within us which leads us
        towards the purpose we were created for: glorifying our Creator and
        enjoying Him. The Bible states that this God-given conscience causes all
        of us to “clearly perceive'' that Christianity <strong>best and perfectly
        explains</strong> our reality.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it is epistemologically impossible to
        show that any model is provably true. In fact, all people live by and
        rely on some unproven model, and this reliance is what Christians call
        <strong>faith</strong>. But, Christians place their faith in the model of Christainity
        because, as C.S. Lewis puts it, “I believe in Christianity as I believe
        that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it
        I see everything else.” Why Chrisitanity is the closest description of
        reality compared to all other models is something we would love to
        discuss with you.</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3>  how is Christianity different from other religions? &#9660;</h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Other religions require that you earn your way to God, but Christianity
        says that is an impossible task. God is infinitely Holy and Perfect that
        we in our sinfulness cannot do anything to get closer to Him. Although
        our sin separates us from God, He extends His grace (undeserved free gift)
        to us through his Son, Jesus Christ. If you accept Jesus as your Lord
        and Savior, He gives you new life in Him.</p>

        <p>Ephesians 2:8-9 says, “For by grace you have been saved through faith.
        And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of
        works, so that no one may boast.”</p>

        <p>Other religions merely present a list of rules to follow, but
        Christianity is more than that. God offers a personal relationship with
        Him. God knows you fully and loves the world, and wants you to know Him
        and to love Him as well.</p>

        <p>Jesus is alive. He resurrected from the dead and has victory over death!
        Many leaders of other religions are dead or distant, but our God is
        alive and active.</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3>  why can’t I just repent before I die? &#9660; </h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>If you could have the greatest treasure in the world, why would you wait
        to have it? The Gospel isn’t just an accessory that we can acquire
        through something we do and then not face eternal suffering.</p>
        <p>If the
        Gospel is truly as valuable as we claim it to be, the Gospel should be
        the center of our lives: “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden
        in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes
        and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of
        heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one
        pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.” -
        Matthew 13:44-46</p>

      <a class="collapsible"><h3>  how do I become Christian? &#9660; </h3></a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It is not a matter of the actions you do yourself that makes you a
        Christian. Everything that we do stems from a realization that an
        omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent God loved us so much that he would
        come down as a human to take the suffering we deserve so that everyone,
        even those persecuting and humiliating him, could have the opportunity
        to be with him.</p>
        <p>Thus, the way one should approach becoming a Christian
        is by first realizing what kind of a God the Christian God is and in the
        light of such a magnificent truth, coming to recognize how sinful we are.</p>
        <p>As Isaiah 64:6 says: “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and
        all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a
        leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.” It is at this point we
        come to recognize and realize that we have been saved from our own sins
        and inability to meet the standards — at this moment we come to see that
        God has sent us the Messiah, Jesus who is God who has paid the price for
        us.</p>
        <p>All we need to do is to believe in this Messiah and to cry out to
        Him for our salvation. Those who put their trust in the one God and
        recognize Jesus as our savior are whom we call Christians.</p>
