  	The Wounded Spirit - Timothy Keller (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkL3R27ZV1o)
Happiness is not determined by external circumstances, but by the way we view, process and address them. Contrary to simple, reductionist views of psychology, the Book of Proverbs presents the inner-life in its complex, multidimensional aspects, offering the means of acquiring the inner health needed to face the challenges of life.

	The Carnal Christian? - R.C. Sproul (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhgBuHVDtmA&)
Do works produce faith, or is it the other way around? There are many who have confused the order of things concerning faith, justification, and works. Dr. Sproul addresses this problem and helps us understand the relationship between faith and works.

	The Tyranny of the Weaker Brother - R.C. Sproul (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hX-ifma5-k&)
Paul indicates that serious problems can arise in the church due to the differences between "weaker brothers" and "stronger brothers." On the one hand, many churches have experienced the "tyranny of the weaker brother," and fallen into an unbiblical legalism. On the other hand, many "stronger brother" do not bear with the failings of the weak. In this message, Dr. R.C. Sproul explains how the church is to maintain peace and unity while living with weaker and stronger brothers.

	A Consuming Fire - R.C. Sproul (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td1rYIVK-W4)
There have always been those who have argued that a truly holy God could not or would not consign anyone to eternal punishment. Such, they say, is inconsistent with God’s love. In this message, Dr. Sproul explains why the holiness of God is not inconsistent with eternal punishment of sin, but in fact requires it.

	Do Not Love the World - Kevin DeYoung (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMF8Dh0jWe8&)
The Apostle John warns us not to love the world, and our fallen tendency to view the world as an ultimate end in itself means that we must fight against our dark inclinations to set our hearts on this age and its pleasures. But God created the world to glorify Himself, and as we make Him our ultimate end, we can identify the sins that manifest our love for the world and enjoy the Lord’s creation in an appropriate way. Rev. Kevin DeYoung calls on the Lord to restore us to a high view of the world as the arena of God’s glory, and he describes how Christians, in pursuing the light of God, can identify and fight against sin in the world while loving our enemies and blessing those who curse us.

	Renew Your Mind - Paul Washer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB6s3iuGYv8)
If a decision you make is truly acceptable and God's will, then it will not contradict what is in the Bible. You don't have to violate God's will in order to carry out His will. Paul Washer elaborates on the necessity of renewing our mind to follow God’s will.
	
	Ongoing Sin - Paul Washer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HynerviUiTc)
Paul Washer tackles the question of how a Christian who has been reborn should face sin and what mindset they should have.

	*The Truth About Hell - John MacArthur (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVzbh_dLq3s&)
In society today, hell is often looked over, watered down, or ignored by churches. John MacArthur points out that it should actually be the first thing we talk about when discussing the gospel since it is about salvation from hell. While the idea that hell exists is generally accepted in America today, the point isn’t made clear that you’re headed there.

	Serious Joy, Cultural Conflict, and Christian Humility: Thoughts on Christian Education - John Piper (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvwT04C6QGo&feature=emb_title&)
True Christian education fills our hearts and minds with a joy so serious and strong that our society loses its power to control where we stand and what we say.
