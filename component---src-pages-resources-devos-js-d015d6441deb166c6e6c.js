We also often pray for God to move in the hearts of those around us, both believers and non-believers. \\n\\nBut how often do we pray for God to move in the hearts of those in authority? How often do we pray for God to move in the heart of Chris Eisgruber? How often do we pray for God to move in the heart of our local government leaders? How often do we pray for God to move in the heart of President Trump? \\nIt can be so easy for us to rule out the possibility of God working in and through certain people. Whether it is politicians, school authorities, or even hardened family members, we often find ourselves being discouraged by their actions rather than praying for them. We somehow think that because they have shown a disregard for God, that God is limited in His power to work through them. \\n\\nIn today’s passage, we see that God “stirred up” the heart of King Cyrus in order to send the Jews back from exile. Isaiah 45:4 tells us that Cyrus did not know God, so this was not as though Cyrus was being moved by his own righteous convictions. This was God working through the heart of the foreign king. \\n\\nBut what is more important to understand is why God worked through the heart of King Cyrus. Verse 1 tells us very clearly that it is that the “word of the Lord might be fulfilled.” God had a perfect plan of redemption for Judah from the very beginning of time, and there was no doubt that it would come to pass. Let us never forget that everything in the universe must bow to the will of the Father. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, what a great encouragement this is! The God we serve is one whose every word will be fulfilled. The God we serve is one whose will comes to pass with more certainty than the rising of the sun. Let us remind ourselves this morning of the power and the authority of our Lord, and that there is nothing that happens to us that is outside of our Father’s will. \\n\\nTherefore, let us pray fervently with great hope and expectation for those that we would not often pray for. Let us pray for those in authority (1 Timothy 2:1-2), let us pray for our hardened and unrepentant family members and friends, let us pray for our bosses and coworkers. \\n\\nAnd when we do pray, let us pray as our Lord taught us to pray: “Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you pray for those in authority/leadership positions? \\n2. Do you place limits on the ways in which God can work?

Previously, we saw both the wrath and love of God for Israel in Malachi along with the signs and result of God’s love being manifested within us in 1 John. Now in Ezra, we will encounter the topic of being faithful to the Lord and his law in all that we do.\\n\\nTo further understand this book, we must first grasp the general context. Decades prior, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and its temple, leading to the Israelites being taken into exile by King Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC. In 539, King Cyrus of Persia overthrew the Babylonian king and allowed the Jewish exiles to return to their home. Ezra now picks up at the time when some Israelites return to Jerusalem in preparation for rebuilding the city.\\n\\nChapters 1 through 6 discuss the rebuilding of the temple prior to Ezra while chapters 7 to 10 elaborate on Ezra’s arrival more than half a century later in 458 BC. In chapter 3, we see the rebuilding of the temple and completion of the very simple foundation. Now in verse 11 and 12 we see different responses to this hopeful action which gives light into the dynamic present between the Israelites. While many sang and praised the Lord giving thanks, many of the priests and Levites wept. The younger generation of Israelites were extremely thrilled to be out of captivity and to help in this project to restore their nation but the elders which consisted of the priests and Levites, responded differently because they still had a vivid memory of the splendor of the temple that was built by Solomon. While it was still exciting and great that this temple was being built, it could not compare to the splendor and glory of the Solomonic temple that was built during the golden age of Israel so to them it was a bittersweet moment. Later in chapter 6, we see the completion of the temple and the celebration for it.\\n\\nNow upon his arrival in chapter 7, Ezra immediately institutes significant reforms among the people because they were still practicing pagan traditions and rituals they learned under captivity and were also married to pagans. As verse 10 notes in chapter 7, “For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel.” That was the main focus Ezra had: not only to teach the law of the Lord but also to emphasize our need to live it out. Matthew Henry, a 17th century Wales minister, noted regarding God’s will that Ezra “made it his business to inquire into it, searched the scriptures, and sought the knowledge of God, of his mind and will, in the scriptures, which is to be found there, but not without seeking.” This is exactly how we should approach scripture. The Bible is not just a book with some good stories but rather the truth and hence something we should study and apply in our lives. So let us tarry in scripture, diligently looking deeper into why a message or sentence was written there and how it should impact us. Only through this can we be prepared to serve God correctly.\\n\\n\\nPlease take this time to read over the whole of Ezra — it does not have to be examined in detail. Understanding the general structure and theme of the book will help in analyzing it closely.\\n\\nHowever, while reading, just highlight interesting notes or questions. Also, if there is a burning question, please email Handa (hchun@princeton.edu), we will make sure to answer it in our devotionals (or if it is really burning, we will answer immediately — let us know).

We saw yesterday that God “stirred up the spirit of Cyrus” (verse 1) to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem, but we see the extent of Cyrus’s conviction in today’s passage. He did not simply declare that the Jewish people could return to restore Jerusalem, but he gave them many provisions and blessings to do so (verse 4). \\n\\nSomething to note is that the Bible tells us that Cyrus did not know God (Isaiah 45:4). One takeaway from this is that a foreign king who did not know God obeyed Him more readily than His own people and kings had done. Brothers and sisters, let us always readily obey the Lord and view service to Him as a privilege, knowing that He can very well choose any other instrument to complete His will. \\n\\nAnother takeaway from this is a reminder of God’s sovereignty. The king of Persia, the great empire of the world at the time, was unable to do anything but bow to the will of the Father though he did not know God. Let us never think that anything is outside the dominion of our Lord, but let us instead pray fervently and boldly that God would advance His kingdom in our hearts and on this earth, trusting that everything is in the Father’s hands.\\n\\nBut something even more important to focus on in this passage is the importance of rebuilding the temple. Note that God did not charge Cyrus with returning the Jews to their land, but rather with rebuilding the temple of God (verse 2).What God made clear by charging Cyrus to rebuild His temple was His intention to dwell among His people once again, just as He had promised. \\n\\nHad the Jews simply returned to Jerusalem without God dwelling among them, they would have been like any other nation. The very identity of the Jewish people was the chosen people of God, and though they were not faithful to this identity, God was still faithful and showed this through the rebuilding of His temple. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us never forget that our greatest identity, our only identity, is a follower of Christ. We can try to strive after different goals and projects, but such things do not define us and we mustn’t let our lives revolve around them. Rather, let us cling to the God who has given us new lives and has gracefully chosen us as His people, and save in nothing else. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Let us reflect on the sovereignty of God. Have we forgotten that He is Lord above all? \\n2. From where do you find your greatest identity?

In this passage, Paul reminds the Gentiles of their lives before they knew Jesus Christ, and he makes it clear that they had no hope of salvation beforehand. In fact, Paul writes of two distinctions that the Gentiles had before they were believers:\\n \\n(1) Social Distinction: Paul writes in verse 11 to those who are called the “uncircumcision” (the Gentiles) by the “circumcision” (the Jews). By using these terms, the Jews were emphasizing that the Gentiles had no share in the covenant of God, since circumcision was the mark of the Abrahamic covenant. And yet, the Gentiles who were once outcasts to the people of God now have no distinction in Christ.\\n \\n(2) Spiritual Distinction: This is the main idea of the passage. Paul starts verse 12 with the fact that the Gentiles “were at that time separated from Christ,” and explains the implications of this:\\n \\nFirst off, they were “alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of the promise.” Paul is again emphasizing that the Gentiles had no share in the promises of God. It is not just that they did not receive the inheritance of the Jewish people, but also that the Gentiles were left with the inheritance of the world, which is sin and death.\\n \\nMore importantly, the Gentiles had “no hope” and were “without God in the world.” We must read these as consequences of being “separated from Christ.” Therefore, Paul is making it clear that without Jesus, there is no hope in this life (as we are “without God”) nor in the life to come.\\n \\nBrothers and sisters, let us realize the depths from which God has saved us and not forget it. In doing so, we can praise God all the more for the works He has done in our lives, and we can excitedly share of the great hope that is only found in Jesus.\\n \\nConsider\\n \\n1.

If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill! Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy! (Ps. 137:4-6)\\n\\nThis is the lament of Psalm 137, the cry of Jews in the midst of Babylonian captivity. Under the rule of a pagan nation, and through the disciple of the Lord, a portion of Judah began to turn back to God and long for Jerusalem. Ezra writes in verse 5 that the heads of Judah, Benjamin and the Levites rose to go rebuild the house of the Lord. Imagine the joyful cheer of these men upon hearing that king Cyrus has allowed them to return home - this must have been unbelievable news!\\n\\nYet despite this miraculous move of God, there were still those who decided to stay in Babylon. Though Babylon had smashed their infants, after seven decades the captives had become comfortable and accustomed in the very land of their affliction. For these people, cowardliness overshadowed a love for God.\\n\\nLeaving Babylon certainly was no easy feat. Not only did these people have to leave their households and familiarity behind, but what stood ahead of them was a thousand mile trek in a hostile war-ridden desert. Even if they made it through this dangerous, expensive journey, it may not even be possible for them to successfully build the temple. They were heading back to Jerusalem, which was a pile of rubble. Yet God showed these people that He is truly sovereign; if He stirred the heart of the Persian King, He would surely use His people to rebuild the temple for His glory. In their decision to return to Jerusalem, these people demonstrated a deep desire for worship and a bold faith in God. \\n\\nAs we read in verse 5, the reason these people rose up is because God had stirred their hearts. Just like how God took the initiative to bring us salvation, it was God who took the initiative to redeem his captive people. Recall in verse 1 that God also “stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia”. We see here that God works in both those He had chosen and those He had not chosen, convicting all parties to work for His glory. The primary end of this act was not for the happiness or fulfillment of the captives but rather that His glory may be revealed to the nations. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, it is God who stirs. We must plead God to stir our hearts and grant us a vision to run after: a community of holy, worshipping, evangelizing Christians. Ezra writes how the heads of the fathers’ houses rose up - do we see this today? Men of God, quit acting like children. Learn to take initiative and stand up with integrity and fortitude. So often we stay up late finishing school projects or chatting with friends, but when is the last time you stayed up for the Lord? The road to revival is a difficult thousand mile trek, but we will see in Ezra how God blesses the fruit of those who take initiative for His Glory. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, we live in Babylon. Let us not be content with this world, but let us restlessly seek God until He stirs our hearts to act boldly for His name.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Is God stirring in your heart? Turn to Him in prayer daily so that you may love your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.\\n2. What activities keep you up at night?

All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nIt was certainly great news when God convicted Cyrus to allow His people to return. It was even greater news when God convicted a group of men to boldly take initiative and embark on a dangerous journey to rebuild His temple. However, many practical challenges remained. Building the temple required many resources that the captives simply did not have. Where would they possibly get all the gold and silver they needed?\\n\\nWe see in verse 6 that though the Jews had nothing, their hunger for God’s kingdom was sufficient for God to provide them with the resources they needed. Commanded by the king, the people around helped these exiles and “aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares”. On top of that, verse 7 says that Cyrus himself brought out the vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had seized. It was already unbelievable that Cyrus would let the captives go, but he did more than that - God stirred Cyrus to provide the necessary materials as well! \\n\\nAs a result, we see in verses 9-10 all that God had faithfully provided. In total, the vessels of gold and silver were 5,400. However, among these materials, the altar of incense, the bronze altar, and the ark of the covenant were missing. God had taken away these things from the Jews, preventing them from worshipping, because they did not have the correct heart. What mattered most were not these physical components. They were merely meant to symbolize a proper heart, so God removed these things to cleanse the Jews of their false worship. In rebuilding the temple, the Jews received another chance. But later on in Malachi, we see that the temple eventually is filled with polluted offerings once again (Mal. 1).\\n\\nBut for now, Ezra introduces Sheshbazzar under the hopes that he will take charge to rebuild the temple and restore true worship. Verse 8 says this great number of gold and silver was counted out to “Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah”. The Bible isn’t clear on this, but many theologians believe that Sheshbazzar is the same as Zerubbabel, the leader of these exiles, whom we will read more about in later chapters. He is referred to by his Babylonian name, Sheshbazzar, while he was still in Babylon in chapter 1, but is later referred to by his Jewish name after he leaves Babylon in the rest of the chapters. God uses Zerubbabel to bring new hope in restoring His Kingdom, but it ultimately does not succeed. However, this picture of Zerubbabel foreshadows something greater. Through the line of Zerubbabel comes Christ (Matt. 1:12), our eternal hope who builds the everlasting Church, allowing us to worship in spirit and truth.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us remember that we are led by Christ, who is far greater than Zerubbabel. Christ promised that he will build his Church and in it, every tribe, tongue, people and nation will one day be gathered (Rev. 7:9). Just like the captives in Babylon, we might gasp and ask how is this possible? Every nation? What do we have to accomplish such a feat? Yet Ezra shows us that the same sovereign God who provided His people with materials to rebuild his temple will provide us with the power to build his Church. \\n\\nAll we need to do is seek after His Glory. Let us remember the advice of Hudson Taylor: “God’s work done in God’s way will not lack God’s means of support.”\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How has God provided for you and what have you done with these gifts? \\n2.

Verses 3 to 20 cover the families as named by the patriarch of the line, and verses 21 to 35 enumerate the people of their ancestral homes.\\n\\n\\nThese show that the Israelites had not forgotten and that they had not lost their hope in God who promised that He would be with them. They remembered the faithfulness of God and His steadfast love through the stories of their fathers, and they held dear to their inheritance of the promised land by remembering their hometowns.\\n\\n\\nThese men listed in our passage today are not special men. In fact, most of the thousands of men who came are not even listed— only their fathers are listed. Furthermore, even most of the fathers are not men of significance in other parts of the Bible. Majority of them were most likely farmers, merchants, butchers, and craftsmen. They were men who had had to do whatever it took to survive in the land of Babylon where they were exiled to. Some of them may have even had to serve under the very leaders and oppressors who had taken away their home and inheritance.\\n\\n\\nThese were not men to be remembered, yet God remembered them.\\n\\n\\nYou see, these men are listed before even the priests and the Levites who served the LORD directly in the temple. They were listed before the most sacred people of the nation of Israel. Yet, it was not because they were of a certain special distinction; we have already made that clear— they were laymen. \\n\\n\\nNo, they are listed first because they were the ordinary people who held fast to the LORD when all hope seemed to have been lost. They are listed first because these were the men who raised up their children and protected their wives from the evil cultures of Babylon. They are recognized by the LORD because they were the remnant who held fast to the faith enough to pack up their entire lives in Babylon, where they had remained for 70 years, because they were broken by the idea that while they lived in paneled houses, the house of LORD lay in the rubbles. They, though they were not appointed to the service of the LORD as were the Levites, had a stirred spirit that desired to glorify the LORD through the raising of the temple and through it, the raising of Israel.\\n\\n\\nSome of these “sons” are from cities like Bethel, Ai, and Jericho. They are from towns that testify of the mighty hand of God in procuring and establishing the nation of Israel. And perhaps, that is what these men remembered. Perhaps it was the story of God appearing to Jacob at Bethel that provoked them to their feet, or perhaps it was the story of Joshua and the men being redeemed at Ai that brought tears to their eyes, or perhaps it was the story of the trumpets at Jericho when the wall came tumbling down that made the men to feel the thumping of their own hearts at the idea of their homeland. Whatever it was that reminded them, one thing is clear. These ordinary men were used by God in the spectacular task of building up the very house of God.\\n\\n\\nMost of us will not be called to pastorship. Most of us will never stand at the pulpit and deliver a winsome sermon that resonates the truth of the Gospel deeply within the hearts of the congregants. Most of us will not write commentaries or books on theology. However, all of us, all of the Church of the living God, are called to a mission of building up the house of God.\\n\\n\\nThis house of God lives within us. His name we all know as Jesus. Just as the house of the LORD was the house of the LORD because God chose to dwell in it, our hearts are the dwelling places of God because God chooses to live in us.

Making up around 4,200 of the Israelites, the priests were a rather small group in comparison to the around 42,000 person company returning to Jerusalem. \\n\\n\\nIn context, under King David 24 priestly divisions were established but only four returned while many remained in Babylon. As our brother Handa mentioned in yesterday’s devotional on the men of Israel, these priests also had a trust and hope in the Lord to restore what was lost. \\n\\n\\nWhile the common response to any difficulty or problem is to just trust God, the Israelites and specifically priests were not facing a trivial matter that could easily be shrugged off with some assurance by others.\\n\\n\\nNebuchadnezzar’s complete destruction of Jerusalem and exile were among the most devastating problems the Israelites faced. Not only was the physical defeat completely demoralizing but the spiritual crisis they were now in made it too much to bear. It seemed clear that God promised them this land for their kingdom, but in the moment it felt like a very clear spiritual defeat. Psalms 137 accounts the deep anguish by the Israelites under captivity, “By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.” Facing such harsh difficulties, one could inevitably think that all is lost. \\n\\n\\nEven though exile and captivity could have possibly left many with a grave hopelessness for a restored kingdom, the priests mentioned in these four verses along with around 38,000 Israelites knew that God made a promise and would not forsake it. \\n\\n\\nThe circumstances of these priests can be an encouragement for those who abide in him. Just as the priests were called to serve the Lord and responsibly lead, we may be called, at times with great responsibility, to serve in various ways.

We see throughout the Kings and Chronicles that Israel and Judah, the sister nations, serve other gods, carve idols, and place their faith in other nations. Hence, the Lord retreats His mercy from Israel to give them the desires of their hearts to serve the gods of their own hearts. God allows for the capture of the holy city, Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 36:17-21).\\n\\nYet, just as God had never left Israel to perish in the past, God retained and sustained the remnant even when all of Israel and Judah had lost the inheritance God had provisioned for their forefathers. These remnants, the protected line of Jacob who would continue the set apart nation of Israel are now returning to Israel according to God’s plan.\\n\\nNow, as the list of returning exiles start here in chapter 2, we come across a very special name in verse 2. It’s the first name on the list of the leaders of the returnees from Babylon, and his name is Zerubbabel.\\n\\nNow, why should we distinguish this name above the others? Why should we care about Zerubbabel? Well, for one, he was probably recognized as the foremost leader of the exiled community at Babylon. Also, as we read in Haggai, he was also the one to whom was given the command to go build the house of the LORD (Haggai 1:1-4). Yet, these raise further questions about his identity: Why was he specifically chosen to rebuild the temple? How was he considered to be the leader of the exiled Israel?\\n\\nWell, to understand, we can go backwards into Israel’s history. Going all the way back to 2 Samuel 7:12-16, we see a covenant God makes with David. This is what we call the Davidic Covenant, and it points to the continuation of David’s line in the establishment of kings forever. Zerubbabel is so important to us because he is of the line of the Davidic kings descended from the throne of Judah. Zerubbabel is central to the faithfulness of God in keeping all of His promises even when Israel has failed so severely on their side of the bargain.\\n\\nHowever, there is more. When we read forward this time in the Scriptures, to the New Testament Gospels, to Matthew 1:12-13 and Luke 3:27, we see Zerubbabel’s name once again— in the genealogy of Jesus.\\n\\nYou see, Zerubbabel is so important because he is the line of the King— that’s a capital K. He is a link in the Messianic chain that would lead to the promised eternal King of Israel, the Messiah, the Savior Jesus Christ. Along with the exiles returning to their homeland to rebuild the temple, there was the very hope and forefather of the Messiah leading them throughout the entire journey and even the temple building.\\n\\nWhen the prophet Zechariah delivers the word of the LORD in chapter 4 of his book— “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it.” — God is not merely referring to the immediate fulfillment of the prophecy through Zerubbabel, but is foreshadowing and foretelling of the complete rebuilding of the temple in the hearts of men.\\n\\nZerubbabel comes to build the second temple that will meet its fate in 70AD— in the destruction of the temple and the Jewish age, but we have the greater Zerubbabel, Jesus Christ, who allowed the tearing down of the temple of His own body to raise it up once again on the third day (John 2:19). Jesus, as He says in John 4:21, builds up the temple of His own body, as the greater Zerubbabel, such that those who have Christ in them will worship in “spirit and truth” (John 4:23).\\n\\nFor us Christians, when we read the many names in the Bible, though we are reading the names of many dead Israelites whom we have never known personally before, we are reading them with the fully assured knowledge that all those names had a part to play in the greater redemptive history that reaches its climax in the person of Jesus whom we so well know personally and is verily alive among us today.\\n\\nThe next couple of passages will be somewhat drab to have to read, but I hope that we would be able to read with a mindset that focuses on the goodness of God’s care in counting every member of humanity towards the salvation plan accomplished in Christ.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Is God within us? It is necessary for us to have Christ in us for us to worship God. Do we act and live as if God is in us?"},"name":"day105"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Ezra 2:40-42: The Levites\\n\\nJuly 8, 2020\\n\\n\\n40 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah, 74. 41 The singers: the sons of Asaph, 128. 42 The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, and the sons of Shobai, in all 139.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nHow carefully do we worship? \\n\\n\\nThis question seems odd at first. After all, we know that God “searches the heart” (Jeremiah 17:10). We tell ourselves that as long as “our hearts are in the right place,” the other details of worship can be overlooked. Or perhaps we read verses such as Hebrews 4:16 which tells us to “come boldly unto the throne”, and we think that we can approach God however we please. \\n\\n\\nHowever, today’s passage provides a sobering reminder that God is not one who can be taken lightly, especially in worship. That is, from this seemingly uninteresting list of Levites and temple staff that returned from exile, we can actually learn much about the nature of worship that God desires. \\n\\n\\nThe first thing we can note from today’s passage is the sheer importance of worship. In the listing of the returning exiles, there is a great portion of text dedicated to the returning priests, Levites, and temple servants. Though the temple had not yet been rebuilt and Jerusalem was still in ruins, the temple staff returned from exile to lead the worship of God, highlighting the fact that worship must be a top priority in the lives of all who serve the Lord.\\n\\n\\nLet each one of us ask ourselves: what importance does worship have in my life? Brothers and sisters, worship is not simply singing a few songs once a week, but it is a daily, continual action. As Paul tells us in Romans 12:1, our “true spiritual worship” is presenting our bodies “as living sacrifices to God.” Does being a living sacrifice to God sit at the top of our priorities for the day? Or has some other task taken its place in our hearts? \\n\\n\\nFurthermore, this passage teaches us the importance of worshipping God correctly. We can clearly see from the fact that there are priests, Levites, and temple servants that there is a structure to corporate worship. And the one that gave this structure of worship was none other than God Himself. Therefore brothers and sisters, let us realize that the only one who decides how God will be worshipped is God Himself!\\n\\n\\nWe may be tempted to think that this was only true in the times of the Old Testament. However, there is clear guidance on worshipping God throughout the New Testament as well. We see the importance of communion in Acts 20:7, the importance of offering in 1 Corinthians 16:1-2, the importance of preaching from the word of God in Acts 2:42, etc. In short, let us not think that we can worship God in any way we please, but rather let us uphold what the Bible teaches about worship. \\n\\n\\nThe final thing to learn about worship from this passage is the importance of pure, unadulterated worship. The Levites and the priests could have very well stayed behind in Babylon, thinking that there was no difference between worshipping God in Jerusalem and worshipping in Babylon. \\n\\n\\nThe Levites that returned, however, knew better than this. They had a desire to worship God not in a foreign land that was full of idolatry and had no fear of God, but in Jerusalem where God had once dwelled. The Levites that returned had set themselves apart from the sinful lifestyles of the Babylonians in order to offer an unadulterated worship to God.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, is our worship to God pure and unadulterated? Do we dare to worship God while there is still unrepentant sin raging on in our lives? Do we come before God on Sunday mornings only to live like the rest of the world throughout the rest of the week? Let not our worship be polluted and tainted by sin in our lives.\\n\\n\\nSadly, many of the Levites did not offer an unadulterated worship to God. Out of the many Levites in exile, we see today that only a handful chose to return to Jerusalem. As for us, let us be like the handful of Levites that chose to return to Jerusalem, making every effort to worship God correctly and wholeheartedly. \\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What priority does worship have in your life?\\n\\n2. Are you careful to worship God as He commands? \\n\\n3. Is your worship pure or is it tainted by unrepentant sin?"},"name":"day108"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Ezra 2:43-58: The Servants\\n\\nJuly 9, 2020\\n\\n43 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth, 44 the sons of Keros, the sons of Siaha, the sons of Padon, 45 the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Akkub, 46 the sons of Hagab, the sons of Shamlai, the sons of Hanan, 47 the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah, 48 the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam, 49 the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai, 50 the sons of Asnah, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephisim, 51 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur, 52 the sons of Bazluth, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha, 53 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah, 54 the sons of Neziah, and the sons of Hatipha.\\n\\n55 The sons of Solomon\'s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Hassophereth, the sons of Peruda, 56 the sons of Jaalah, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, 57 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, and the sons of Ami.\\n\\n58 All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon\'s servants were 392.\\n\\n \\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nIn the past few devotionals, we read through the men, priests, and Levites that returned to Jerusalem from Babylon. Today, we see the temple servants that returned from exile, but the focus of this passage is not actually on the servants themselves. In fact, the focus of this entire section is not on those that returned from exile, but rather on God’s covenant faithfulness. \\n\\n\\nWe see from the Jewish people returning from exile that God was faithful to His promise to restore His covenant people. The passage is actually highlighting this faithfulness, and this provides great insight into how we as Christians should view service to God.\\n\\n\\nThat is, our service to God should not highlight our own goodness or piety, but rather the glory and the goodness of God. There was no doubt that the temple servants had made a difficult decision in leaving the comfort of their lives in Babylon in order to go serve God in their deserted homeland. There was no doubt that the temple servants had countless responsibilities in order to help facilitate the worship of God. And yet, the passage does not touch on this at all because the glory is not to be bestowed upon the servants, but rather upon the one who is served: God. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us examine our hearts when we serve the Lord. Do we truly do everything for the sake of God’s glory and His kingdom, or is there some part of us that desires recognition for our service? Do we act differently when there are people watching, or do we live as those who know that they are always seen by their Father above? Do we even have a heart of service at all? \\n\\n\\nBut what is astounding in all of this is the fact that the passage still recognizes the service of the temple servants by listing the families they are from. Though the focus is on God’s goodness and faithfulness, God Himself recognizes and remembers each temple servant for their service to Him. \\n\\n\\nThough the tasks of the temple servants may seem less glamorous or prestigious than that of the priests or Levites, they are still named and recognized by God. Let us read this and realize that God does not care for the things that this world cares about in status or prestige. Rather, our God seeks and honors those that humbly and faithfully offer themselves to Him. \\n\\n\\nTherefore, let each one of us commit everything that we do to the glory of God. Though we might think that we have less to offer to God because we don’t have certain internships or talents, let us not forget that our God simply asks that we dedicate ourselves to Him, for He is not one who is limited by the abilities of the ones that serve Him. \\n\\n\\nThis morning, may we serve God and God alone. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Do you have a desire for recognition in your works, or do you desire that God be glorified? \\n\\n2. Is the recognition of man or God more important to you?"},"name":"day109"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Ephesians 2:13-17: Peace with God and His People in Christ\\nApril 2, 2020\\n\\n13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility 15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, 16 and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. 17 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nIn yesterday’s devotional (Ephesians 2:11-12) we saw the hopelessness of the Gentiles. They were separated from the people of God and from God Himself, and they had no share in His covenant. They were “far off.” To add insult to injury, the Jews looked down on the Gentiles because of this, leading to further separation between the two groups.\\nIn this moment of hopelessness, Paul points to “the blood of Christ” that brings us Gentiles near. The problem was estrangement and distance; the solution is nearness through the blood of Jesus.\\n\\nWhy the blood? We have to realize that the cause of all division is due to sin. So when this sin is removed, there is nearness for those “who were once far off.” But sin doesn’t just disappear. In fact, we know from the Bible that sin must be paid for. And for those who believe in Christ, His blood pays this price in full. Therefore, we who are no longer slaves to sin (Romans 6) in Jesus are brought near. \\n\\nWhat does this mean?  For one, it means that “there is no dividing wall of hostility” between Jew and Gentile, or between any believers for that matter. In the times of the Bible, there were literal walls in the temple that marked off sections for Jew and Gentile. Furthermore, the laws of the Jews were often used as a “wall” to distinguish themselves from Gentiles, whether it be their strict dietary restrictions or their practice of circumcision. \\n\\nBut since Jesus “abolish[ed]” the law, there is no longer this basis for hostility between Jew and Gentile. The law was abolished because Jesus perfectly fulfilled the law and all who believe are declared righteous in Him. Therefore, there is no basis for distinction between Jew and Gentile, as they are now both under the Lordship of Jesus Christ, not an exclusive law. \\n\\nNot only that, they are both “one” in Jesus. In other words, they are one body of Christ. That is why the text says “that he might create in himself one man in place of the two.” It is a new identity for both Jew and Gentile. Rather than their ethnic or cultural backgrounds, their greatest identity was now Jesus Himself. For all who believe, their greatest identity is Jesus. \\n\\nThe more important implication is that Jesus “reconciles us to God” by making us righteous before God (as explained earlier). Imagine being hostile towards the Almighty Creator, and that is exactly where we were because we are sinful creatures. However, Jesus’s death and blood makes us sinless before God, so this hostility is gone! \\n\\nTherefore, the only basis of peace, both with others and with God Himself is Jesus Christ. It does not matter whether Jew or Gentile, poor or rich, young or old. The only thing that matters is whether we are in Jesus or not. So brothers and sisters, let us truly ask ourselves this morning “am I in Christ?” Until then, you have no basis of reconciliation with others. Until then, you have no basis of reconciliation with the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What is our greatest identity? There are many identities this world has to offer on the basis of race, occupation, school, etc. But there is only one identity that matters: in Jesus or  not.\\n\\n2. Do we still distinguish ourselves from other believers? Perhaps we find certain brothers and sisters annoying or a bit overbearing. Perhaps we say that we are different from those other Christians.

This passage lists out people who have lost track of their heritage. Generally speaking, most of the exiles seem to have remembered their genealogy because we see that each person returns to his own city. However, verses 59-60 show that there were 652 people who “could not prove their fathers’ houses or their descent”. \\n\\n\\nBeing part of the covenant family of God was very important. God chose the patriarchs to establish a family that would be set apart and become a holy nation. They were to represent the Kingdom of God. Part of this was demonstrating that belonging to God was exclusive to those who believed in Him and walked by His Law. Thus, losing their genealogy demonstrates how apathetic the Jews were towards clinging on to their role as God’s chosen nation. \\n\\n\\nIn verses 61-62, we see that some priests “sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but they were not found there”. Because their genealogy was uncertain, they were prohibited from the priesthood and considered to be unclean. Here we see just how carefully the Jews treated the law - if it was not absolutely certain that they were part of the priestly lineage, they could not partake in priestly activities. So in order to fix this, verse 63 says that they should consult Urim and Thummim. According to Leviticus 8:8, these were components of the garment of the high priest used to seek the Lord’s will.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that even the priestly lineage had been spoiled shows that Israel had truly lost its proper structure of worship. Brothers and sisters, is our place in the family of God something we take for granted? This was so important to the Jews that they could list their ancestors many generations back; but today, we can’t even read through a passage about genealogies without groaning in boredom! \\n\\n\\nLet us praise God for establishing a permanent family structure in Christ through His Church. For we who are born again by the power of the Holy Spirit have full assurance that we are part of the family of God. We need not meticulously trace back our ancestry tree. Simply look to the cross, where our Father “predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ” (Eph. 1:5)! \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

Who can stand against it? We see in verse 64 that He brought a whole assembly of 42,360 of His remnant out of their captivity. Including servants and singers, verse 65 shows that the size of this entire group was roughly 50,000 people. Finally, the remnant has assembled, ready to rebuild God’s temple and restore a place for proper worship.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the first thing that these people did when they got back? Verses 68-69 tell us that they returned to where the Temple of God used to be and began to offer their gifts willingly so that it may be restored. This is a powerful reminder of what happened when the Tabernacle was first built. In Exodus 36:2-6, God stirred in the hearts of the Israelites to use their skills and their freewill offerings for His glory. The Bible tells us that there were craftsmen doing every sort of task and there were offerings more than enough for doing the work that the Lord had commanded.\\n\\n\\n\\nLikewise, we see here all the people gathered, pouring themselves out in service. Whether it be priests or singers or doorkeepers, people gifted in various sorts of tasks came to restore this place of worship. Brothers and sisters, God is still calling us to build His Church today. What do we have to offer Him? Even now, we are called to be cheerful givers; as Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 9:7, “each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver”. Let us give as we rejoice in building up His Church.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not forget that those who returned to Jerusalem were merely the remnant God had stirred. As the early historian Josephus wrote, “many remained in Babylon, being unwilling to leave their possessions”. It would be wrong to think that those who stayed in Babylon lacked any form of spiritual life. Some still studied the Law and followed their traditions, but those whom God had stirred longed for something deeper. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, we can easily enter into a routine of church attendance and daily devotionals but have the heart of those who remained in captivity. Examine yourself and ask: am I merely living a spiritual life, or am I living in true worship? Our aim in worship is not to evoke a sense of fulfillment, but to meet with God and respond in a way that radiates His glory! Let us come together, freely offer our lives to Christ, and build a Church that gives Him the worship that He deserves!\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n\\n1.

It is no coincidence that the altar is the first work that is rebuilt. While it is logistically easier to build in comparison to an entire temple, the deeper reason as to why it was built first lies in the second half of verse 2, “the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.”\\n\\n\\nAt the altar, the Israelites would provide offerings for atonement of their sins. Hence rebuilding the altar first signifies the need for God’s mercy and forgiveness to a sinful nation. This obedience and dedication to God is a very important theme we as Christians should also apply in our lives through everything that we do even if it is offering the first 10% of the money we receive to God.\\n\\n\\nNow continuing to verse 3, we encounter a significant and exemplary action from the Israelites. In yesterday’s devotional, Handa elaborated on the importance and reason for coming together as one: to know who God is and to worship him properly. Given that understanding of unity here with the Israelites, the beginning portion of verse 3 is further magnified, “for fear was on them because of the peoples of the land, and they offered burnt offerings.”\\n\\n\\nThe Israelites were not surrounded by allies but rather other idolatrous nations that staunchly opposed this form of pure religion. Following through with their worship without a doubt puts them at risk of danger and could actually lead to severe ramifications. Yet even with this inevitable fear, the Israelites act in a way that should be a model for all of us: they still sacrificed their offerings to God. \\n\\n\\nAs a Christian, you will definitely face moments in life when you may be fearful of the world around you, whether it be physical danger or being publicly ostracized, since the gospel will be offensive to the world. Understanding this, I exhort you to remain steadfast in the word rather than conform to a message that is more appealing to the world. \\n\\n\\nAt times fear as a natural response to a situation may be hard to control but the important point of today’s devotional is to reflect on how the Israelites responded and hence how we should also respond. Worshipping God and offering sacrifices before him is not an action that is reserved for when you are feeling good. Obedience to God is done regardless of the situation and how you are feeling. \\n\\n\\nUnity with other brothers and sisters in the body of Christ will definitely help when you face fear. Fighting the good fight along with other brothers and sisters will not only sharpen you but keep you on the right path. So let us all trust and glorify God, fearing him more than man. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Has it ever been difficult to worship or offer a sacrifice to God because of something in your life?\\n\\n2.

Meanwhile, the rest of Israel went back to their remembered homelands to enjoy their inheritance once again.\\n\\n\\nA lot of us can attest to the joy of being home and enjoying the homecooking of our parents or the simple pleasure of knowing that we are at a place that we feel like we belong to. This joy, I assume, was what these Israelites returning from their exile must have felt. They may have been delighted at the idea that now they were able to work the farmlands and pastures that their ancestors had procured and God had restored for them.\\n\\n\\nThe Israelites had their towns.\\n\\n\\nThey had a place to call home even when they were exiled in a foreign land.

Because the land was promised to them and because the land was guaranteed to be theirs by the word of God Himself, Israelites were secure in their blessings of the land.\\n\\n\\nFor those who know the feeling of home, it is a blessing of God that you get to feel it.\\n\\n\\nThough many of us many understand the joy these Israelites may have felt, many of us also cannot. Perhaps, we have never known where this place called “home” was supposed to be, or perhaps, we never felt so “at home” in those places people called “home”, or perhaps, we are sick of our homes and do not want to be home.\\n\\n\\nFor those of us who feel this way, there is hope. There is a promise for the weary traveller who wants to rest his head, but cannot find a place on earth. There is the promise that Jacob saw when he rested his head on a rock at Bethel. There is the promise of the gateway to heaven through Jesus Christ, and the home we have access to through the Way.\\n\\n\\nHere, we are exiles hoping and waiting for our call back home, but at home, in the clear presence of God, we will have the satisfaction and fullness of endless joy that we so look forward to.

We will see the light of the Son of God rising as the sun and realize in His light that we are shining in our joy and satisfaction as well.\\n\\n\\nThese Israelites had a great inheritance awaiting them in Israel, and when they entered into their towns, they would have rejoiced in the faithfulness of God. For the Christian, an even greater allotment and inheritance awaits. For the Christian, what is guaranteed is more than the perishing lands of this old earth, but the eternal, everlasting allotment in the new garden.\\n\\n\\nOften enough, we are easily caught up with the passing world. We dedicate ourselves to the improvement of this dying world without setting our eyes on the eternal.

Notice how Paul begins v1 by saying “For this reason, I, Paul ...”. Normally “for this reason” is a phrase that takes the thoughts that precede it and connects them to a response that follows from it, yet we see this sentence is cut off (try reading it). We are left wondering, what follows from “this reason”? What is Paul’s response to the things he has said?\\n\\nThis is why we need to take a step back, read forwards and backwards, and then return to v1. First, what is “this reason”? Do you remember what Paul talked about in chapters 1-2? Paul proclaimed a handful of rich truths: the predestination in Christ (Eph. 1:4), inheritance in Christ (Eph. 1:11), unity in Christ (Eph. 2:13), and life in Christ (Eph. 2:5), to name a few. When Paul says “for this reason, I, Paul,...”, he is saying “because of these truths, I…”.\\n\\nBut then you might notice that v2-v13 is just a continuation of more awesome, encouraging, and powerful Gospel truths. It’s as if Paul couldn’t help but keep talking on and on about how stunning this revealed mystery of the Gospel is - so much so that he interrupts himself in v1 to proclaim truths about God for another 12 verses! \\n\\nBut finally, in v14, Paul finishes his progression of thought. Paul says, “For this reason I bow my knees before the Father”. All of these truths that Paul writes in chapter 2-3 lead to a response in prayer! And what does Paul pray for? In short, he wants these Christians to truly understand “what is the breadth and length and height and depth” of the love of Christ! \\n\\nThis is an important primer for reading the book of Ephesians. This is a book filled with doctrinal truths, and when we read them, we need to learn to respond like how Paul wants the church of Ephesus to respond. These truths need to captivate our hearts so that we know the depth of Christ’s love, and if they don’t, we need to pray until they do. If our hearts are hardened, and if this book is no more than words on a page (or pixels on a screen) to us, Ephesians is of no use!\\n\\nSo, before looking at v1, let\'s spend some time reading all of Ephesians 2-3 (which isn’t that long), allowing these truths to preach to our hearts.\\n\\nNow, let\'s go back to v1. Notice how Paul calls himself a prisoner of Christ Jesus. Paul purposefully uses the word “prisoner” because while he was writing this letter, he was indeed in prison, specifically as a prisoner of Caesar. At least that’s how many Christians probably thought of it. But instead, Paul sees himself as a prisoner of Christ. It’s not Caesar who determines the day Paul is set free; it is Christ, far above all rule and authority (Eph. 1:21), who determines when Paul is put into chains and when Paul is set free. \\n\\nIs this also the case for you? Paul was specifically in house arrest in Rome (Acts 28:30-31), while many of us are likewise quarantined in our homes. Do we forget that we are not a prisoner of COVID19 but that we are instead a prisoner for Christ? It is not COVID19 that determines when we are set free or what conditions we are to bear, but it is instead Christ who determines these things for God’s glory.\\n\\nWhat does it mean for us to be a prisoner of Christ? Are we in an unfortunate circumstance, such that we should be pitied? No! That’s why Paul tells the church not to feel sorry for him when he says “I ask of you not to lose heart over when I am suffering for you, which is your glory” (Eph. 3:13). In our captivity, as prisoners of Christ, everything is for his glory and in that we ought to rejoice. We ought to be like Paul, who writes and mediates on the “immeasurable riches of Christ” (Eph. 3:8) with delight! We ought to mirror how Paul does not cease to give thanks for his fellow saints (Eph. 1:15). We ought to pray in response to how good God is, asking to know His goodness even more (Eph 1:15-23, 3:14-21)! We ought to be evangelizing like Paul who made it known throughout the whole imperial guard that his imprisonment is for Christ, causing other Christians to be “much more bold to speak the word without fear” (Phil. 1:12-14). If we do not have these qualities, are we forgetting that we belong to Christ, that we are not a captive of COVID19? \\n\\nAt the end of v1, Paul writes that this imprisonment is “on behalf of you Gentiles”. This is because of several things. First, Paul was arrested because he was spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles. Secondly, Ephesians 1:13 says it was for “your glory”; the glory of the Gentiles is Christ himself, and through Paul’s imprisonment, Christ is glorified as Paul lays down his life for the advancement of the Gospel in love. Moreover, there are circumstances that came about from this imprisonment that benefitted the Gentiles. Not only was the Gospel spread throughout the imperial guard (who are Gentiles), but Paul was also able to write the books of Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians and Philemon, which were used mightily by God as Scripture. \\n\\nLikewise, our imprisonment may lead us to glorify Him in ways we would not have done otherwise. In the quietness of isolation, we have an opportunity to wrestle with God and pray for hours without any distraction. And just like how the imperial guard notices something different in Paul, perhaps our non-Christian friends may notice something different in us and come to know Him. Let’s rejoice that as prisoners of Christ, God will have all the glory!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Meditate on this question: Are you a prisoner of Christ or a captive of COVID19?\\n\\n2.

We are united with Jews to become a new (Christain) man because of the blood of Christ. \\n\\nVerse 18 summarizes our Covenant like this: “through him (Christ) we both (Jew and Gentile) have access in one Spirit (Holy Spirit) to the Father (God).” This sentence so concisely and precisely describes our relationship with God by pointing to his triune nature. Meditate on this verse. It’s as if the sentence just said “God’s nature” and “us” but beautifully interlaced the two together with words, entangling us with the trinity. Do you see how our relationship with the triune God knits together in every aspect of Christian life? \\n\\nThink about prayer. Even our petitions are filled with pride and ignorance for we do not know how to pray as we ought (Rom. 8:26). Yet the Spirit searches our hearts and guides us according to the Father’s will (Rom. 8:27). On top of that, the Spirit and the Son intercedes for us (Rom. 8:27, 34) - our prayers are joined with their perfect prayers! \\n\\nOr think about worship. Our worship is still tainted by competing desires from our sinful hearts. Yet because of the Spirit, we are in Christ! Christ, who said “I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do” (John. 17:4) poured himself out in the perfect act of worship - our worship is offered with his perfect worship (because we are in him)! \\n\\nOur relationship with God is filled with this crucial “to the Father by the Son through the Holy Spirit” dynamic. We cannot know God if we do not know the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nNotice how in v18 it says “we both”. Not only do you experience this, but you share in this experience with other Christians. These people may be as different from you as a Jew is to a Gentile. Yet all across the world, through different cultures and ethnic divides, v19 says we are united together as fellow citizens of the household of God. Think about how marvelous this is. USA, China, France, Korea, Nigeria, Colombia, Mexico, Russia - millions of different people yet one God! What other religion is so ethnically and culturally diverse, bringing together “strangers and aliens”? \\n\\nYet how powerful is it that these ethnic tensions, which in history have erupted into catastrophic wars, can fellowship together because we share “one Spirit”? Together, Paul says we form the “fullness of him” (Eph. 1:23) by becoming a “holy temple in the Lord”. Paul tells us what this temple will be like in v20-22. This temple will never fall because v20 says it rests atop an unmovable cornerstone, Christ Jesus himself. This temple will be Holy because v22 says it is “a dwelling place for God”. This temple will be perfect because v21 says “the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple” not under the supervision of a human architect but rather by the power of the Holy Spirit, the “Spirit of life” (Rom. 8:2). \\n\\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the word “temple”? It likely resembles a building. Perhaps, we try imagining what Solomon’s temple looked like. But “temple” is nothing more than a dwelling place for God and a worship place for us. In Genesis 1, all creation was God’s temple! Genesis 3:8 says He “walked in the garden” and so God must have dwelled at Eden. This is the type of temple that God has restored for us and in us - one that fills His whole creation, but this time, in Christ, it will be vastly better than Eden. \\n\\nWe Christians, from all across this world, have come together in unity to form the Church, the body of Christ, “like living stones” (1 Pet. 2:5), to glorify and enjoy our triune God and partake in manifesting the “fullness of him who fills all in all” (Eph. 1:23)!\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Does the trinity matter to you? How would life be any different if God was unitarian? Spend some time meditating on God’s triune nature for that is who He is!\\n\\n2. As a local body of believers, are we truly united in Christ or is something else the cornerstone of our temple? For instance, maybe this period of isolation could reveal that we have elevated social interactions above Christ while we were together. Spend some time in self-examination and prayer while enjoying the unity we share in Him!"},"name":"day12"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Ezra 3:1: Scattered Now Gathered as One Man\\n\\nJuly 13, 2020\\n\\n\\nWhen the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nIn today’s passage, we see the Israelites gather as “one man” in Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\nImagine over a hundred thousand people gathering in one city for a celebration. The Israelites had gathered for the Feast of Booths— a celebration reminding them of the 40 years in the wilderness. The Israelites would set up tents to dwell in during the days of the feast and remind themselves of the struggles that God delivered Israel from. This time, the Israelites could remember not only the salvation from the wilderness out of Egypt, but also the wilderness they had to endure on their journey from Babylon to Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\nThe interesting thing about this passage is that the over hundred thousand people of Israel gathered as “one man”. This shows that even though these Israelites had been scattered in the Babylonian empire and now had returned to Israel after many, many years, they were united in their desire to live out the Law of Moses (verse 2).\\n\\n\\nThese Israelites were united with a purpose and a desire to worship God and to remember how God had restored Israel from the powers of Egypt once before, and how God would continue to be faithful in His promises to Abraham, Jacob, and David. This is how they could gather as if they were one man.\\n\\n\\nThis image of Israel gathering as one man points us forward in history to the Church.\\n\\n\\nWith the Church, we have one man. We have the Body that is composed of all the believers, and we have the Head who is Christ. The Church, as one man, is united with the singular purpose and desire to worship God and remember how God has restored us from the powers of sin, and how God will continue to be faithful in His promises to uphold us and to strengthen us. This is how the Church can gather as if one man in the presence of God.\\n\\n\\nJust as the Israelites were able to gather with the one desire to worship God through the celebration of His festivals and the rebuilding of His temple, the Church gathers each Lord’s Day to celebrate the work of the cross and the rebuilding of His temple in our hearts.\\n\\n\\nOften, the world and even the churchgoers think that the purpose of the gathering of the Church is for social reasons or for planning moralistic actions throughout the rest of the days of the week. Although both of these things may happen during a meeting of the saints, they are most certainly not the actual reasons for the Church to gather.\\n\\n\\nThe Church gathers on the Lord’s Day to do none other than worship. The purpose of the Church is to worship and to give praise to God for what He has done and for who He is.\\n\\n\\nThese Israelites from all over the nation of Israel gathered in one location in order to worship the Lord through the provisions of the ceremonies and sacrifices. They gathered to prepare their hearts and their hands for the work of restoring the glory of God to Jerusalem through the building of the temple. Although the feast would have included the company of fellow Israelites and the sharing of delicious food, the Israelites were not gathering for that purpose— they gathered to worship the Lord.\\n\\n\\nThere are a lot of talks about unity in the Church. People love to emphasize the need for ignoring the differences we have with one another to pursue unity above all things. I agree, unity is important, however, we must understand that unity of the Church is not something that we achieve through human compromises and contracts, but as we see here in the passage today, unity is achieved when people come together to worship God. Unity is not something that comes as a result of people seeking unity for unity’s sake, but unity is something that comes naturally when people come together to know God and worship God.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, I pray and hope that the Church will be able to see that all that we need in forming a proper Church is found in recognizing God for who He is— that is theology, and in the correct worship of Him.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

Not only that, but he makes it clear that despite his background (Acts 8:1-3), he has been adopted to God to serve God by the will of God (John 1:12-13).\\n\\nThen, Paul goes on to also establish the identity of the church in Ephesus. That is, they are the saints (meaning “the set apart, the holy”), and therefore, they are the ones who are faithful in Christ Jesus. Those who are saints are the ones who can truly be faithful to Christ Jesus, because they are in Christ Jesus.\\n\\nSo, what does it mean to be in Christ Jesus?\\n\\nJust as Christ was faithful to the Father unto death and resurrection — that is, it was His faithfulness that bought us our faith — we can be faithful and holy (“set apart”) because of Christ’s faithfulness. This means that when we adorn Christ and are in Christ, we can also be faithful.\\n\\nIt is as though we have put on Christ and therefore we no longer wear filthy rags, but now are considered as the perfect righteousness and faithfulness of Christ. Not only that, but we who have been reborn in Christ, those who are grafted into the true vine of Christ, are now a new creation that can produce good fruit (John 15:5).\\n\\nAnd because of this truth, by the co-working of “God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” and the Spirit who proceeded from them to inspire these words that we read, the church has the grace and peace that we so enjoy. We as the saints, as those who are in one body, but perhaps currently in different locations far away — for the recipients of this letter, as far as Ephesus — can say that we are still one and still perfectly held together because of our Father and Lord Jesus Christ. What grace God has given us and what peace we can enjoy in being one with fellow brothers and sisters across the world!\\n\\nWherever you are, brothers and sisters, rejoice and know that Christ is with us even in our separation, loneliness, and chaos, and know that we are together in one spirit.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

During this event, the Israelites were to live in tents, or “booths” for one week, as a reminder of their time in the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. More specifically, they were to recall God’s faithfulness during that time and joyfully celebrate it. \\n\\n\\nHowever, what is especially significant about this specific Feast of Booths is the fact that the returning exiles are once again in the “wilderness.” That is, though they returned to Jerusalem, their temple is destroyed and their land is barren. Therefore, celebrating the Feast of Booths was not simply a reminder of God’s past faithfulness after the exodus from Egypt, but a testament to God’s current faithfulness after returning from Babylon. \\n\\n\\nNot only did the returning exiles observe this feast, but we see that they observed it carefully. They observed each and every specific sacrifice for this feast that was outlined in Numbers 29:12-38. Furthermore, they continued to offer “freewill sacrifices” (verse 5), meaning that they offered more than what was required of the law, despite not having much to give. It is safe to say that these exiles were truly expressing their gratitude and trust in God’s faithfulness. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, do we actively remember God’s faithfulness in our lives and trust in Him? Just as the returning exiles remembered God’s past faithfulness despite living in the “wilderness” of the destroyed Jerusalem, we too must remember and celebrate God’s faithfulness as we wait for our Savior’s return. \\n\\n\\nThis morning, let us actively meditate on God’s great faithfulness that He has demonstrated in our own lives. Let us meditate on the fact that 2000 years ago, God sent His only begotten Son as the greatest demonstration of His love and faithfulness towards us.

We see only a bloodied Jesus on the cross who seems so weak and powerless before the Roman guards taunting and casting lots for His clothing.\\n\\nJesus did, of course, not count His deity to be something to be grasped when He came to earth (Philippians 2:6-7), but that does not mean He was not the conquering King, the Lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5). He was the slain lamb, but through it He is the Lion.\\n\\nThat is what Paul is getting to us in this passage. In verse 7, Paul talks about the “working of his power” — that is, God’s, and this, we may, at the surface level, see  as God’s exercising of divine authority in revealing to Paul the Gospel (Galatians 1:11-12). However, not only is Paul talking about the one occurrence at which he received the Gospel when he talks about the power of God, but He is talking about the entirety of the exercise of God’s power in allowing for such Gospel to be made possible for him, a persecutor of the Church (Galatians 1:13). God’s “working of his power” stretches to the whole of the Old Testament, and reaches a climax at the cross where Jesus, through His weakness, reveals the greatest extent of His power.\\n\\nWe, as Christians, assert that the Gospel, the idea that God died for man, is power. That would have surprised the people of the times — the supposed God of the universe dying at the hands of mortals? Zeus, or Poseidon, or Hades would have merely smitten any mortal daring to touch the gods. Yet, because our God is so mighty, He dies for mankind as they cannot meet the mighty standard He desires. He is so powerful that His stepping off the throne does not demean His magnificence, but it magnifies Him even more. This is the God who turns Paul, the supposed “least of all the saints” (if he’s the least, what are we?), into a preacher to the Gentiles (verse 8). Christ is God so magnificent that He is the “unsearchable riches” a man would sell all things to acquire (Matthew 13:44). This is the all-creating God who created all that we know and see so that the mystery of the Gospel is hidden in it so as to reveal the glory of Christ that all may worship Him as a result of it (verse 9).\\n\\nOur Gospel is the good news from such a God. He had known us from before us birth and had planned for us all to be where we are right now even before time began (Psalm 139:13-14) In this powerful and magnificent God, we have all the authority and power given by Christ as we are the church through whom “the manifold wisdom of God” is known to even the heavenly rulers and authorities (verse 10).\\n\\nThe death and resurrection of Christ, though seemingly a story of weakness and failure, is actually for the Christian the power of the God given to us in the nicely wrapped package of the Gospel. Through it, we the Gentiles have received “the unsearchable riches of Christ,” (verse 8) and have been the vessels through which God’s wisdom is revealed even to “the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places” — that is, the angels and demons.\\n\\nThe Gospel is power to us because it points to the God who created us, the Son who died and lives for us, and the Spirit who lives in us.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

He claims here that the Gospel going out to all the nations through Paul has been “according to the eternal purpose” of God. We are talking about the entirety of God’s plan from His creation of mankind to the day when Jesus will finally come back, and beyond — all of it was according to the purpose of God. Even from the choosing of Israel to the destruction of the temple, God had planned it all to the point of finally truly allowing all of the nations to become under God’s one sovereign rule.\\n\\nFurthermore, Paul says this “eternal purpose” was “realized in Christ Jesus our Lord” (verse 11). The word for “realized” in a more direct definition means “accomplished” or “made.” God the Father had created all the world and had chosen the elect to give the Church as a bride to the Son, and when Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30), He had accomplished the eternal purpose of the Father in creating this world. We see that the Father gave, and the Son paid the bride-price for His beloved bride, the Church.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for the Church? Paul answers it in verse 12; it means that “we have boldness and access with confidence” — boldness and access? For what? To what?\\n\\nWe have the boldness for our position as children of God (Ephesians 3:6), and we have access to the Father who holds all things in His hands. We can approach the Father in prayer (which Paul does in the next couple verses) for we are children and heirs who have been given the authority and privilege to approach the God of the universe with confidence. The image is that of a child running to the Father whose arms are open wide — the most powerful ruler of the universe gets down on His knee to lift His children up and looks upon His children with joy and favor. What an amazing truth!\\n\\nAll this, not because we deserved it, but because Christ accomplished our adoption for us (Romans 8:15-17; Ephesians 1:5). We have been adopted — welcomed as sons and daughters because Christ has prepared a room in the Father’s house for us (John 14:2). As legitimized sons and daughters of the God Most High, we have no fear in death or guilt in life as the song “In Christ Alone” goes. You see, we have no fear of the devil who has no hold on us, and we have only love from the Father who holds the control over both our body and soul (Matthew 10:28).\\n\\nThis security in the Father, through Christ, is why Paul can ask the Ephesians to not lose heart over how Paul is suffering for them (verse 13). Paul does not lose heart though he may suffer shipwrecks or beatings or imprisonment not because he has the assurance that he will get the end result that his own heart desires in any difficult situation that he encounters, but rather because he knows that He has the Father who will always give him what he needs — whether that be more suffering or rest from a weary journey. He has this guarantee in the scars of Jesus from those nails and the Spirit that is within him (Ephesians 1:13).\\n\\nTherefore, we, the Church, do not lose heart in the struggles of this life — especially when we are persecuted for our faith. Rather, we look to the Father who gives us only good things (Matthew 11:17) for He is preparing us through the gift of that suffering to become more aware of what we have in Christ and how much greater that is in comparison to what this world can offer us.\\n\\nThis Passion Week, it is quite unfortunate that we are not able to gather as one physical body to worship together, to read the Word together, and to reflect on the journey of Christ to the cross together. However, even in this pandemic outbreak, let us remember that this, even this, is preparing for us to know how much we already are given by the Father who loves us (more than any of even our loving parents can love us) in Christ who suffered for us and sympathizes with us.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. It’s sometimes hard to remember that God is our Father. How can we have more confidence in our faith knowing this truth?\\n\\n2.

He had grown up a Hebrew of Hebrews, and lived his life devout to the Torah — a Pharisee (Philippians 3:4-6). He was the last person imaginable to affirm a new covenant Israel — much less suffer for their sake (verse 1). He was of the “other generations” who did not know the mystery (verse 5).\\n\\nYet, when he received through revelation (Galatians 2:2) this mystery of the Gospel that opens the doors for all the nations to become a child of God, he became a prisoner to Christ for the Gentiles. Now, instead of standing opposed to the followers of Jesus who opened arms for Samaritans and Proselytes, Paul stood rebuking Jesus’s own disciples for not being bold enough to accept the Gentiles (Galatians 2:12-14). Once a chief of the persecutors of Christ, now was a mere steward for that same Christ (verse 2).\\n\\nOh! The mystery is that all those who were once wild olive shoots became grafted into the olive tree of Jesus Christ to be called His people (Romans 11:17). They did not deserve to be grafted in, nor be given titles as “heirs” (verse 6). It was truly a mystery that all the nations would one day come to call God their own, and for God to call these foreigners His own (Hosea 2:23).\\n\\nThis was what Paul was given stewardship of (verse 2). To him was revealed this mystery (verse 3) of how those who did not have the law, nor the covenant promise given to Abraham, would come to be “fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus” (verse 6).\\n\\nWe cannot take this mystery lightly! For this truth and mystery of the Gospel changed the course of Paul’s life and those of the Ephesians he preached to. How can such a powerful Gospel leave us unmarred and untouched, glued to our seats, and not stirred within our hearts?\\n\\nPaul himself wants the reader to know the extent to which he is desperate and passionate for this Gospel that extends to the Gentiles beyond the walls of Jerusalem. He cries, “you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ” in his writing this letter (verse 4). This insight means the knowledge and wisdom he has been given, but even more than that, he means to convey the extent to which those knowledge and wisdom transforms him to live out that Gospel to the extremes of being beaten, shipwrecked, becoming hungry, and stoned to near death (2 Corinthians 11:23-29). His insight into the mystery of Christ is shown through His dedication to the Ephesians in explaining the Gospel through this very letter.\\n\\nPaul was the Apostle given such charge over the Gentiles to share the Good News to, but he was certainly not the only saint to be given the charge. We, as Christians who have been called to “make disciples of all nations” must carry on the torch that Paul passed on (Matthew 28:19-20). We are Gentiles like Timothy, Priscilla, and Aquila, but equally a part of New Jerusalem as any of the Old Testament heroes.\\n\\nDuring this Passion Week, let us consider what drives us. Is it the same fire that was within Paul? Are we burning to want to share the Gospel truth that Jesus died for us and lived again? We know the mystery of Christ that the world does not know and we know that we are heirs of Christ because of the suffering that Jesus walked through.\\n\\nCould we be challenged this week, and the weeks to come to share the suffering of Christ and the love that was shown through it — even if it means losing as much as Paul did?\\n\\nBrothers and sister, “Therefore, let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured.

In verse 17, Paul prays that “Christ may dwell in [our] hearts through faith.” This is interesting because Paul is writing to Christians, in whom Christ already dwells. But what Paul is talking about is the continual and growing indwelling of Christ’s power in our lives. We must realize, brothers and sisters, that Jesus is not someone that we simply “accept,” only for us to continue to live as we please. Rather, He must become increasingly present in our hearts. \\n\\nAnd this brings about a growth in our understanding of how great Christ’s love for us is. And we need “strength to comprehend” this love because it is just so unbelievably great that it “surpasses knowledge.” Have we begun to comprehend this unimaginable love? Or do we remain relatively unmoved? \\n\\nAs Jonathan Edwards puts it, we must have both light and heat with respect to the love of Christ. We must have the “light” in the sense that we grow in our knowledge and understanding of this love. But we must also have the “heat” — the passion that comes with this true understanding. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, what better time is there than right now, during this Passion Week, for us to pray as Paul did for a greater understanding of Christ’s love? What could be a better use of our days than growing in our knowledge of so great a love? Let us continue to meditate on this love until we are burning with passion and gratitude for the Lord. \\n\\nWhat does this all lead to? If we look at verse 19, Paul says that we will be “filled with all the fullness of God.” There is truly nothing more to gain or to get than this fullness and satisfaction. That is what fullness means! And yet, we are so bent on finding our fullness and satisfaction elsewhere. This morning, let us remind ourselves of Christ’s great love for us and be filled with the fullness of God, not the emptiness of this world. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n1. Do we have both the heat and the light?\\n2. Are we filled with the fullness of God or are seeking to fill ourselves with other things? \\n3.

The first time he prayed was in Ephesians 1:15-23, and that was for enlightenment of the hope and inheritance that we have in Christ. This time, he is praying for enablement because of what we have in Christ. \\n\\nHerein lies something very important for all of us to realize. We can have the “enlightenment and head knowledge” of the Gospel. We can know all of the miraculous things that Jesus has done for us, and we can know all the theological terms and the right things to say. But that is all meaningless on its own. We must also be strengthened by Him for His great purposes, just as Paul says in verse 16. \\n\\nImagine that you have a beautiful Lamborghini worth millions of dollars that is sure to make heads turn. But for whatever reason, you don’t drive the car. In fact, you keep it in your garage and don’t even speak of the car, let alone drive it. I think that you and I can agree that this would be foolish and almost wasteful. And yet, this is essentially what we do when we know the Gospel but refuse to have it empower and change our lives. \\n\\nNow, let us move to a closer look at the text. In verse 14, Paul says “for this reason, I bow my knees before the Father.” For what reason? This verse is actually a continuation of verse 1, as verses 2-13 are like a big parentheses of additional information. And the reason that verse 1 points to is found in the last verse of Chapter 2: “In Him you are also being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.” Paul is praying that the Holy Spirit that is given to us would strengthen us.\\n\\nIt is also interesting to note that Paul bows his knee “before the Father.” The word Father conveys intimacy, underlining the reconciliation with God that Paul explained just earlier. \\n\\nAnd because Paul knows of the relationship that we now enjoy with God the Father through Christ, he boldly prays for our empowerment by the Spirit. Let us have this same boldness in prayer when we intercede for ourselves and others, not relying on our own merit or goodness, but rather appealing to “the riches of His glory.”\\n\\nOne final thing to draw attention to is that Paul prays that we would be strengthened in our “inner being.” Our inner being is our soul, it is the essence of who we are. Knowing this, let us evaluate the following statement: “God has strengthened my inner being and the essence of who I am through His Spirit, but there is no change in my life.” Brothers and sisters, this is an absurd and stupid thing to say. May our lives not echo this statement. \\n\\nConsider\\n1. Do we boldly come before the Father when we intercede for ourselves and for others? \\n2.

Specifically, Paul actually glorifies God as the one who is deserving of all blessings with his usage of the Greek there (eulogetos). You can almost think of it as Paul blessing and commanding, “Bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”\\n\\nSo why is God deserving of blessings? Why is He deserving of all our worship and praise?\\n\\nFirst, it is because He is God. Specifically, He is not just a god, but He is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. We Christians see Jesus as not only a good teacher, or a worldly king, but as our one true God. If so, and if this God that Paul blesses is God as well, we are talking about the same God. Those who say they put their faith in Jesus must also put their faith in God the Father as well for the two testify of each other (John 5:37,39).\\n\\nSecondly, it is because He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore He is our Father as well. Jesus, by His work on the cross, has made it possible for us to be called His brothers (Hebrews 2:11), and thereby allowed for us to be able to call God the Father our Father as we have been called sons in verse 5 (Romans 8:16-17).\\n\\nThirdly, it is because He sent Jesus to bless us with “every spiritual blessing” (verse 3). That is to say, we have been blessed in Christ — through Jesus we have received “every spiritual blessing.” What wonderful news that is! That we need not work for every blessing that is available to us, that we need not through our vain works seek out holiness and blamelessness that we cannot possibly obtain through our own merit, but that we have been “chosen” to be saved by Christ and to be “holy and blameless before him” (verse 4).\\n\\nOur blessing, the same blessing Paul wants to remind the Ephesians of, the one that we have received so freely, is the blessing of Christ Himself from whom we have received every blessing imaginable. What greater joy than to receive God Himself?\\n\\nNot only that, God did this without condition, before we did anything good or bad, through predestination from “before the foundation of the world” (verse 4). It was not our works that allowed us to be adopted from our fallen nature, but rather that He did it “in love [...] according to the purpose of His will” (verse 5). God the Father, in love, sent His Beloved who showed perfect love on the cross, so that we may know His love shown to the Son as the Father loves the Son and may become His beloved.\\n\\nThat leads us to the final reason why we must bless the Father and why we are blessed to be able to do so.\\n\\nGod did it all, for “the praise of his glorious grace” (verse 6). God created the world — even its foundation, created us — who would sin against Him, sent down Jesus — who would die on the cross for our sins and resurrect, and built the Church, for the praise of Himself. We praise God and bless our God because as we have seen above, we have been given enough reasons to do so — and it is our blessing to do so.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, as we are children of the one God (verse 5), let us, even in times when it feels like we are separated from the rest of our siblings, to worship together in spirit to our God and Father.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How can you worship God today? How have you already done so?\\n\\n2. Do we take Jesus for granted? Have we ever considered Him as our blessing Himself — not just looked for His blessings?\\n\\n3.

Amen.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nOn this Good Friday, let us drop the busyness of our lives and fix our eyes upon the glory of the cross. As we close the third chapter of Ephesians, let us share in doing so by meditating on how Paul ends his prayer by giving glory to God. \\n\\nVerse 20 tells us who Paul is giving glory to, namely “to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think”. When Paul writes “to him”, he is referring to God the Father, who in His power raised Christ “far above all rule and authority and power and dominion” (Eph 1:21). We know this because Paul specifically begins his prayer by saying “I bow my knees before the Father” (Eph 3:14). This connects with the second half of verse 20, “according to the power at work within us”, because it is precisely God’s power that allows us, through Christ, to call him Father when we are made alive by the Spirit, which both enlightens us and enables us (see Wednesday’s devo). This is the same power that made Paul, a persecutor of the Church, a minister with “the stewardship of God’s grace” (Eph 3:2). \\n\\nLet this be a reminder of why Good Friday is so good! When we say “Good Friday”, the adjective “good” is far more than its lackluster everyday usage. Rather, it describes the highest expression of Good that ever was, is, and will be. It is the cross that brings us regeneration in Christ so that we can call God “Father”. It is the cross that institutes the New Covenant, where God cleanses us and fills us with the power of the Holy Spirit (Eze 36:25-26). Echoing all of his parables and signs, Christ did something for us that we would never be able to do for ourselves - Christ was lost so that we could be found (Luke 15), Christ was forsaken so that we could be intimately known (Matt 27:46), Christ was made unclean so that we could be clean (Luke 8:43-48), Christ became thirsty so that we could have living water (John 19:28), and Christ became dead so that in Him we could have life (John 11:25)! \\n\\nPaul ends his prayer in verse 21 when he proclaims “to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus”. By this he refers to Christ, who is the head of the church, and the church, which is the body of Christ (Eph 2:16), giving glory to God as a collective whole, unified by one Spirit (Eph 2:18). Let us today give glory to God by responding to how Christ gave glory to God. \\n\\nNever forget that it was for the glory of God that Christ died. As it is written in the Gospel of John, “Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” (John 12:27-28). \\n\\nRecognize that our sin not only defiles us, but it utterly dishonors God. Sin spits on and belittles an infinitely almighty God who rightfully deserves all of our worship. When we sin, we place this perfect God below filthy idols! How incredibly repulsive this is! For such a heinous crime to go unnoticed would be utterly unjust. But on Good Friday, as infinite glory was stripped away from Jesus, all of the glory of God that we detracted from Him in sin was fully restored. Herein lies the greatest act of justice that we remember on this “Good Friday”. As Christ vindicated God’s glory, it was a “fragrant offering and sacrifice to God” (Eph 5:2) for “it pleased the LORD to crush him” (Isa 53:10). \\n\\nPaul ends by saying this glory should be given to him “throughout all generations, forever and ever”. The Spirit is still working through us now, thousands of years later, pointing us towards what Christ did, since God’s plan is “for the fullness of time” (Eph 1:10). \\n\\nThe crucifixion was more than perfect Justice - what Christ did on Good Friday was also perfect Love. As pastors often say, it wasn’t the nails that held Christ on that cursed tree but rather it was his Love that held him there. How joyful it is that God’s glory abounds so much that we can go on and on looking for the glories of Christ’s sacrifice and still not find it all. There is more glory in the cross than we can possibly imagine; its greatness is “immeasurable” (Eph 1:19), its riches are “unsearchable” (Eph 3:8), and its love “surpassess knowledge” (Eph 3:19). To this, let us with Paul say “Amen.”\\n\\n###\\n\\nOn top of our normal exegetical devotional, we would also like to share a topical devotional inspired by the idea that God is “able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think” (verse 20). These next few paragraphs are incredibly important and practical, so we hope you enjoy reading it!\\n\\nDo you believe in prayer? Few Christians would deny the power of prayer - scripture is riddled with calls to pray and speaks often of God being a Father who listens and answers prayer requests. We may have heard amazing testimonies of God answering prayer requests of famous Christians we respect such as John Piper, Paul Washer, or even certain Christians in our circles who are known for having experienced the power of God in extraordinary ways. For a lot of Christians however, there almost seems to be a disconnect in what we know God can do in prayer and what we believe God does. \\n\\nWe say, “Is praying really going to change my circumstances? I mean isn’t everything predestined anyway? God works all things for good, so prayer is just a way for me to have conversation with God and not actually anything that actually has power.”\\n\\nIn my case, I realized that my low view of prayer was due to my unbelief. It was due to a low view of God. For me, even though I testified biblical truths about God, internally I did not believe them. In reality, even though I would never admit it at the time, I viewed God as a distant God who perhaps was not active in the affairs of man, while simultaneously having an ultimate good plan. I believed in what God did do through Jesus on the cross, and what God will do in the future in his second coming, but I now realized I doubted and underestimated God’s power and authority today. \\n\\nJames 1:5-7 says, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.” Jesus himself says, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.” Is this a promise we believe in? We are instructed to ask in faith, and if we doubt, we shouldn’t expect anything. When we pray, do we believe that God is a living and active God, who “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think”?\\n\\nPeter, after denying Jesus three times, during the day of the Pentecost stands up, filled with the Holy Spirit, and preaches the gospel to a crowd that was composed of even the very same people that crucified Jesus. 5000 people were cut to the heart and came to Christ that day. He was not the most educated. He was not the most eloquent. In his weakness, God’s glory was displayed and Peter witnessed a historic day that showcased what God is truly capable of doing.\\n\\nThe Bible says that when we come to faith, we become like a dead man walking, someone who was asleep and “dulled” to the things of God, but suddenly awakened, alive, and now a completely new person. Oftentimes, in our evangelism, and in our own witness, we don’t truly believe that God is capable of even using our witness to cause our non-Christian friends to become born again. We naturally doubt God’s power and think, “I’d be lucky if they see Christianity as a rational counterpart to naturalism.”\\n\\nThe power of God is at work, and he alone is capable of making dead bones arise. He is God the Redeemer, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Through Jesus Christ’s first coming, he showcased his glory, and through his second coming, he came to wipe away sin and crush the “prince of the power of the air” once and for all. But when Jesus gives us the Great Commission to make disciples out of all the nations until the gospel reaches the ends of the earth, when Stephen was stoned to death and yet, being so filled with the Spirit, he “saw the glory of God” as the “heavens opened up”, when Peter preaches to the murderers of Christ and 5000 came to faith, when Paul counts everything as loss and endures the worst of beatings, starvation, imprisonment, and betrayal all for the “greater gain” of knowing Christ that he plants churches all across the world, surely they did not believe that God is only a God of the past and distant future. He is the God of the present who will show his glory throughout all generations, forever and ever. It’s the Lord’s guarantee. \\n\\nLift up your dropping hands, strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet. The Lord your God goes before you, he has come to establish dominion over all authorities in heaven and on earth. He has come to save his people, to raise them from the dead. Believe! Have faith in the power of God in prayer, in praise, and in works. He will restore his church. He will respond and show his glory in infinitely grander ways than you could ever imagine.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Why is Good Friday so “Good”? Spend some time to meditate and enjoy the simple Gospel.\\n2. Do you believe that God actually answers prayers?\\n3. Do you know he has glory, splendor, and power beyond your imagination?\\n4.

Here, in the next three verses, we see why we, the Church, must walk in unity with one another.\\n\\nPaul here quite simply explains that the Church is one body and in the one Spirit (that is, the Holy Spirit) given to us by God because we all are “called to the one hope that belongs to your call” (verse 4) . To clarify, he is essentially saying that we were called to hope, and there is one hope that is within our calling. Within the calling (effectual calling to come to faith) is an embedded hope that binds the Church together to be one body no matter the backgrounds, status, and occupation. So, what exactly is this hope that belongs to our call?\\n\\nPaul explains it in the next two verses in four steps, “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all” (verse 5-6).\\n\\nOne Lord. Through the most costly transaction recorded in all history, we have been purchased (1 Corinthians 6:20), and we now have one Lord by whom we were called and must serve. His name is Jesus, and He is the Son of God. He has risen from the grace upon His fulfillment of all prophecies and covenants, and with His resurrection, He assured us as His people and Himself as the Lord over us, His people.\\n\\nOne faith. Because we have Christ Jesus as our Lord, we also have one faith in Him. Our faith is not in ourselves, our own flesh, and the works of our own hands, but is in the redeeming work of Christ upon the cross. Our faith is that Jesus Christ died once and for all for the sins of His Church and that the Church no longer are slaves to sin, but slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:17-18). We have been made heirs in God’s eyes.\\n\\nOne baptism. We have received the baptism of water and Spirit (John 3:5) and we who were dead in sin have now come alive in Christ. We are no longer dead beings walking in a world that is dead, but we are live beings bringing a dead world to life. By our repentance and receiving of God’s grace, we have been given a new life that we could not have imagined in our death before.\\n\\nOne God and Father of all. We have a God “who is over all” — He has the control over all things. Even in the darkest of times, when it seems like the storms of this life are rocking our ship back and forth with no sign of solid ground, God is still in control. We have a God who is “through all” — He is revealing Himself through all things, and is with us through all things. We have a God who is “in all” — in even the smallest of His mighty creation, His beauty and work is seen. This God, this magnificent, marvelous, and mighty God, is our Father.

Racial, national, physical, geographical, and other identities are secondary to the one that we have in Christ - blood-bought and adopted into His family. \\n\\nWe are called and urged to unity because as Romans 11:36 tells us, it is from God, through God, and to God and thus gives Him glory forever. \\n\\nIt is from God because it is His very Triunity - the state of the loving community of three Persons in one - that gives us the model of unity and enables us to love each other. Ephesians 3:14-21 makes that abundantly clear for us: Paul prays to the Father who strengthens us with power through His Spirit so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith and that we may know the love of Christ and the fullness of God. It is through God because it is His Spirit that strengthens us (16) and gives us the power at work within us (20). The chapter closes by giving to Him His due glory in the unified church and in Christ Jesus (21), demonstrating once again the  beautiful nature of the Trinity and that the singular, unified church glorifies Him. \\n\\nUpon writing on the truths of our God, Paul then urges the church at Ephesus to walk in a manner worthy of their calling (4:1) as sons and daughters of the Most High and people eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (3). This unity speaks to our communion with God himself and with one another. While we await a perfect unity with God and with others in our eternal rest, we must currently seek unity with God and one another now. \\n\\nWe are not unified to one another by any “secondary” identities but by His blood and His dwelling within us. We achieve this unity by dealing with one another with all humility and gentleness, patience, and most of all love with hearts that are not reluctant but are eager for maintaining the unity of the Spirit. We are not unified to God himself by the works of our hands or the righteousness that we work towards, but by the fact that He loved us first. Let us seek communion with our Lord through vigorous prayer and reading of His Word. \\n\\nAs we remember our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ’s death this Easter weekend, let us seek to remember also His life and ministry, all of which He spent living out virtues until He demonstrated that perfect love that surpasses knowledge (3:19) by dying on that wretched cross. Let us then pick up our spiritual weapon of prayer as Paul did, and ask that we may be strengthened to walk as a unified body in a manner worthy of our calling, and with humility, gentleness, patience, and love as Jesus did 2000 years ago.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How have you been seeking and striving towards unity with your immediate community members (family members, host families, neighbors, etc.) even while social distancing?

We see that not only is this grace given to us, but it is given to us “according to the measure of Christ’s gift.” What is the measure of Christ’s gift?\\n\\nI believe, here, Paul is pointing back to the undeserved gift that we have received which is grace — He is pointing to the very fact that Jesus has “ascended on high” (verse 8; Psalm 68:18). Specifically, he is pointing to the magnitude of Christ’s ascension and what that means for His “captives” who were carried up with Him. Often we do not think of Christ’s ascension (Acts 1:6-11) as part of God’s grace upon us, but it was during this ascension that Jesus reminded His disciples of the Holy Spirit that will come upon them, and also it was then that Jesus gave hope that in the same way the Church will be lifted up. Furthermore, it showed where Jesus originally belonged, and therefore showed us how much more it was glory for us that he “descended” for us (verse 9).\\n\\nIn this way, Paul is describing the “measure of Christ’s gift” in two folds. First, it is the extent of God’s magnitude: His perfectly enough amount of gift of which we shall not be in want (Psalm 23:1). Secondly, it is a reminder of the gift of the Spirit that we as Christians receive who is enough for us to sustain us. Not just “enough” in the general sense of the word, but enough perfectly according to our needs, and transforming us to meet the needs of the Church.\\n\\nWhen Jesus ascended on high, “he led a host of captives” (verse 8). Those captives are those who have been conquered, and therefore have now been won over to the Kingdom of God (Revelation 5:5). These captives are the Church, and they are the “gifts to men” (verse 8). This is not to say that we in ourselves are the gifts, but we are the gifts to men with the grace within us that has transformed us to be “apostles, the prophets [...]” (verse 11). That is to say, we have been transformed by the grace of Christ given to us in amazing measures to be the gifts to the world that they may also receive the grace of God.\\n\\nUpon explaining this, Paul feels the need to go into a parenthetical to explain the extent of this ascension of Christ (verses 9-10). He emphasizes that Jesus must have descended “into lower regions, the earth” because that news of the humble incarnation for a God who has come from so high is an idea of love and grace so unimaginable! This shows the extent of the “measure of Christ’s gift” — it is extending and connecting heaven and earth (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51)!\\n\\nThis Christ, who descended to a level unbefitting of the Creator of the World, have not only ascended to heaven to be alone, but to “fill all things” (verse 10). This is to say that He has filled us with the Holy Spirit, and therefore we are always with Christ, and furthermore, we are awaiting also for the physical day when all the earth will be new and the heavens will be news and the world will be filled with the saints lifting up Christ in worship and praise.\\n\\nThis is our Christ, and the extent of His mercy and grace in even His ascension. Because He has ascended, we have Him in our hearts, and we have the hope of ascending with the rest of the saints as well to be glorified with the Son besides the Father.\\n\\nLet us embrace such a gift that we have received in Him.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

In addition to the sufficient Word of God presented to us in 66 books of the Bible, and the Holy Spirit to guide us, God gave us those who have been called to the occupation of ministry. They are “the apostles, the prophets, the evangelist, the shepherds and teachers” (verse 11). We no longer have the apostles who were called directly by Jesus and were eyewitnesses of Jesus, but their works and writings still remain with us through the Bible they were inspired to write part of, and by the seeds they sowed as with the spilling of their blood to make the Gospel known to the ends of the earth.\\n\\nAs for the others, the early church had prophets who led the Church through their gifts of revelations from God though today, their prominence and leading is debated. The evangelists, those particularly gifted with the ability and passion to share the Gospel, are fundamental in going out to the nations and making known the truth among those who do not yet know the Messiah. The shepherds, those who are given the gift to lead and to shelter the Church so they may not be led astray, are seen in the works of pastors and church leaders who care and love their flock. The teachers, who are often shepherds, admonish the members of the Body with revelation from the Word of God to point their eyes to the Lord Most High.\\n\\nAll these roles exist “to equip the saints for the work of ministry”, meaning they are given such gifts to reveal, evangelize, shepherd, and teach for the sake of equipping others to do ministry. Their ministry is to teach others to do their ministry (verse 12). When Paul says “saint,” he is not leaving out the roles he previously mentioned, but he includes them in the “saints” who are to do ministry. This means that no matter who you are, your main job, your primary goal in life, is to do ministry. Just as the number of roles that “equip” is many, the number of roles in “ministry” is many. Whatever we are called to during a season in our life, we are to do ministry.\\n\\nWhat is this “ministry”? Paul answers it immediately — it is “building up the body of Christ” (verse 12). It is to strengthen the Body by feeding it the Word of God, practicing the love of Christ through outreach, and relying on God in prayer. As members of the Church grow together in their respective ways, the Body grows as one.\\n\\nAnd we are to do it “to mature manhood” (verse 13). This manhood is described as arriving “to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” (verse 13). We can never arrive at the perfection that is Christ, but we look up to Jesus as would a younger brother to the older brother who came before him (of course He is much more than that to us). We try our best to become like Him and to be molded into His likeness — mature manhood is not arriving at the position of Christ (which is heretical and an impossibility), but rather arriving at the point of maturity that seems to model Christ. When people look at this Christian, “the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” becomes apparent.\\n\\nWe do this by attaining “the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God” — we become more like Christ as we come to have faith in Him and get to know him more and more (verse 13). When we learn from the teachers and are shepherded, we gain knowledge and faith of Christ and that should transform us, making us mature into a likeness of Christ.\\n\\nWhat does this look like? — verses 14 to 16 will explain in tomorrow’s devo.\\n\\nMeanwhile, brothers and sisters, I pray you consider if you have truly looked up to Christ and have been mature in becoming like Him — growing “to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” (verse 13). If not, if people cannot tell that you are a follower of Christ, it must be repented of.\\n\\nLet us look to Him and become more like Him.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

It is a slippery slope for those that profess Christ but want to continue to chase after their own desires. Paul makes it clear in these verses that we are all called to live holy and separate lives from the rest of the world and from our past selves. \\n\\nIn verse 17, Paul begins to break down the natural condition of mankind: we are “futile” in our minds. This does not mean that those apart from Christ are not capable of significant intellectual achievement or intriguing philosophical thought. In fact, we see many of what we might describe as the brightest minds coming from non-believers. But what this verse is saying is that all of this is foolish and worthless without God. As Proverbs 9:10 says, “the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.” There is no wisdom or goodness that can come from the heart of man that is apart from God. \\n\\nPaul continues to shine a light on the natural state of our hearts in verse 18. We were all once “darkened in our understanding” because of our hardened hearts. If we continue to chase after the things of this world and ignore the life that God has called us to, our hearts only grow colder to the God from whom all understanding and goodness flows. \\n\\nWhy were our hearts hardened? Verse 19 states that it is because we were given up into our own desires. But let us not deceive ourselves, and think that our hearts are now immune to being hardened. This is a lie. Whenever we desire something more than God, our hearts are hardened and it becomes much easier to commit sin, the sin that is described as “sensuality” and “every kind of impurity.” It is easy to read these words and be tempted to place ourselves on a pedestal by thinking that we are good enough people to never commit such sins. But as we saw above, there is no goodness without God, and there is no limit to how evil the human heart can become. \\n\\nTherefore, we must be wary of our own desires and longings. It is a common pitfall for Christians to simply “follow their heart” rather than the Word of God and the discipline of the church. Brothers and sisters, we must tear down our pride that says we are good people, and realize that our hearts are evil. Only then will we cling so closely to the Word of God and confess our daily need for guidance from the only One who is good.  \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

We put off our old self willingly because we recognize that the sins in which we once walked were like poison to us, corrupting us (Eph. 4:22). We then put on our new self, which is given freely to us through Christ, and we do this by setting our minds on spiritual things instead of worldly things (Eph. 4:23). Paul now goes into the practical implications of this, which is why he begins verse 25 with “therefore”. \\n\\nPaul then says “having put away falsehood” which is another way of saying “having put away anything that is not Christ”. Here, “falsehood” means more than lying words; it refers to all the ways the old self used to walk, alienated from God because of ignorance (Eph. 4:18). Thus, putting away falsehood simply means being in Christ, who is truth (Eph. 4:21).\\n\\nIn light of this, verse 25 instructs Christians to instead “speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another”. We ought not only to speak words that are true, but we ought to speak in Christ, for what we do or say has an effect on the entire body of believers. Even a seemingly inconsequential conversation with another person can be a profound blessing or curse for the entire body. \\n\\nPaul then follows in verse 26 by saying “be angry but do not sin”. It is important to note here that anger and sin are not mutually exclusive! It is possible to have a loving, righteous, self-controlled, God-honoring anger that is led by the Spirit. But most of the time when we are angry, it is likely rooted in our prideful and sinful nature. We are like the older brother, who is self-righteously angry at his prodigal sibling (Luke 15:28), or like Jonah, who is angry over the death of a plant and indifferent about the souls of thousands in Nineveh (Jnh. 4:9). Anger is only righteous when it is over God’s name being profaned and God’s holiness being perverted. It should have nothing to do with us. That being said, though anger may be justified, we ought to still be slow to anger (Jam. 1:19), as God is likewise slow to anger (Exo. 34:6), and practice mercy over judgement (Jam. 2:13). However, being slow to anger does not mean ignoring anger altogether; Paul says “do not let the sun go down on your anger” because if we simply brush things aside and harbor our anger, it could lead to bitterness, vengeance, or even malice. God governs the world in perfect Justice even when we sleep, and we must trust in Him rather than constantly clenching on to our anger. \\n\\nIn light of this, Paul warns in verse 27 to “give no opportunity to the devil”. There is a devil who knows how to attack our weak points and prowls around like a lion seeking something to devour (1 Pet. 5:8). Therefore, we must not compromise any part of our life; it would be foolish to think, I’ll just work on one spiritual area at a time. \\n\\nIn verses 28-29, Paul gives two examples of what it means to put off the old self and put on the new self. These examples were particularly relevant for those living in Ephesus at the time, and we must likewise follow these examples accordingly in the context of our own lives and culture. We see in verse 28 that the thief should not only stop stealing, but also do honest work “so that he may have something to share with anyone in need”. Likewise, not only should we stop all corrupting talk, for we will be judged by every careless word we speak (Matt. 12:36), but our words should be “only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion (something good in one circumstance does not imply that it is good in another), that it may give grace to those who hear”. These are cases that model a complete transformation. We should not only put off our old self, but must also put on our new self! It is this total transformation, where our corruption is turned into a blessing for others, that powerfully testifies how God, rich in mercy, brought us from dead to life (Eph. 2:4-5)! \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Are you giving opportunities to the devil? Meditate on what your spiritual weaknesses are and fight viciously against sin!\\n2. We often think it\'s enough to just put off our old self. What are ways in which you can put on your new self and be a blessing to others?\\n3.

It is not uncommon to hear that someone has “grown so much this past year” or that someone has “grown so much during their time at Princeton.” We praise God for such growth, and it is certainly something to get excited about. But what are these statements based on? \\n\\nHere, Paul gives us some insight as to what growth in Christ looks like (and what it does not look like). \\n\\nWe see that in verse 14, mature Christians are not “tossed to and fro by the waves.” Without a solid foundation in Christ and who He is, we cannot help but be like the ship without an anchor, inconstant in our judgements and so easily swayed by the deceit in this world. This is why all Christians must study the Word carefully, lest we be tossed to and fro. Furthermore, we cannot pick and choose the parts of the Word that we will be anchored in. As soon as we compromise one part of God’s Word to our own liking, we have become that ship that is “carried about by every wind of doctrine” (verse 14). \\n\\nNotice that movement is not the same as growth in verse 14. As Christians, it can be so easy to chase after emotional highs—many times to simply crash back down. Without a deeper affection for Christ (and those around us) and a deeper knowledge of who He is, this is simply movement. Brothers and sisters, let us long to grow in Christ, not simply be moved back and forth. \\n\\nHow then are we supposed to grow? “By speaking the truth in love” (verse 15). That is, we live by the truth of Christ and His Word in love. This truth is a crucial part of our growth, but we mustn’t neglect to love others and teach this truth out of love, rather than out of spite. Likewise, love is at the heart of Christianiy, but without the truth, it has no basis. Thus, truth and love must be coupled together in our lives. \\n\\nHowever, we cannot only focus on ourselves and our own personal growth because there is no such thing when we are in Christ. Rather, we must remember that we are a part of the body of Christ that “when each part is working properly...builds itself up in love” (verse 16). Brothers and sisters, let us never think that our growth or sin is a personal matter that affects only ourselves. Instead, let us grow as a body, encouraging and speaking the truth to one another in love.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Are you growing in Christ? \\n2. Is your life rooted solely in the Word of God?\\n3.

Christian, do not continue walking in sin because God has removed the hardness of your heart (Eph. 4:18). Do not strive to fill yourself with intellectual achievements as they are nothing but futility (Eph. 4:17) without the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10). Paul states sharply in verse 20 that this “is not the way you learned Christ!” \\n\\nHow is it then that Christ is learned? Paul explains in verse 21 that instead, this is a process of firstly hearing about Christ and secondly being taught in him. Here, “him” refers to Jesus, and we see at the end of this verse that “the truth is in Jesus”. In other words, Paul is saying a Christian must be taught “in truth” which is Christ himself. This is why Paul says that in order to grow as a body, we are to speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). Without this truth, our love has no basis, causing us to be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine (Eph. 4:14); truth is found in Christ and in nothing apart from Christ. While this may seem obvious, recognize that many congregations are not being taught in him, or worse, not even hearing about him! This is why Paul is careful to begin the sentence with the word “assuming” - let us always be vigilant to fight against false teachings!\\n\\nAnd what is learned in Christ? Paul explains in the next few verses that we are taught in him to put off your old self and put on the new self. These verses explain how we are to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which we have been called in response to God’s gift of grace (Eph. 4:1). By the grace of God, we are given a new heart of desires and practices that we must put on to replace our old desires and practices. Notice how in verse 22, “put off” is still a command; we should not wait idly for our old desires and practices to disappear. We are to follow the example of the first Christians in Ephesus, where “a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them” (Acts 19:19) - we must burn away the ways of our old self. But make no mistake, we can do these works only because we are a new creation in Christ (2 Cor 5:17). Recall that we were “created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them” (Eph. 2:10). \\n\\nAs we are enlightened by the Spirit, we realize in verse 21 that our “former manner of life is corrupt through deceitful desires”. Here, the Greek word for “corrupt” is associated with the process of rotting and wasting away. In our blindness, we enjoyed these desires and practices without realizing that they were like poisons that would defile us. But now, we put off the old self willingly, recognizing that these desires were “deceitful”. \\n\\nMoreover, verse 24 states that we must “put on the new self”. The good news here is that we do not need to make this “new self” but rather we are simply told to put it on! It has already been “created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness!” While our old self inherited a sinful nature of futility and ignorance in Adam, our new self is created in Christ, from whom we inherit this righteousness and holiness. \\n\\nHow are we to put off our old self and put on our new self? Verse 23, which is sandwiched between the aforementioned phrases, clearly instructs the Christian to be “renewed in the spirit of your minds”. Simply put, set your mind on things that are above, not on things of this Earth (Col. 3:2). It is by the renewal of your mind that you are transformed to no longer be conformed to this world (Romans 12:2). Christian, take off your prison clothes, which robs your joy and corrupts your soul, for the victory is already won! Delight in your new self - freely given to you and purchased by Christ!\\n  \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Meditate on your attitudes, desires, and actions - see if there is any part of your old self that you still have not put off. Do you recognize how corrupt and deceitful they are? Do you recognize that in Christ you have the ability to overcome?\\n2. Do you set your mind on God in everything that you do?

Paul has already described the ways in which we must differ from the world in the past couple verses, but I believe the main reason a Christian should not commit such sins as the Gentiles lies in this one verse in verse 30 that asks the Christian not to “grieve the Holy Spirit of God”.\\n\\nWe, the children of God, who were loved by God, do not sin and rather, hate sin because of the fact that we hate the idea of grieving the God who has set his royal “seal” upon us (verse 30). He has set us apart for the “day of redemption” and shown us, the elect, His redeeming love that makes us into new, distinct creatures. \\n\\nIf we can truly say that we love Christ — that we have come to know that Christ loved us, and therefore we also love Him (1 John 4:19), how can we be okay and indifferent to doing something that grieves Him? Will you be able to say that you love your parents and lash out at them with a knife to their hearts? Will you nail your own brother to the cross again and again as you enjoy the sin that corrupts you? I doubt that that person can say he loves.\\n\\nDo we grieve the Holy Spirit? Is there unrepentant sin that you simply set aside and make excuses for? Do you love that sin more so than Christ so you take it and claim it as lord over your life to grieve our Lord? If you are truly a Christian who has been “sealed” with the Holy Spirit within you, this idea that you may have unrepentant, recurring sin should grieve you to the point of desiring even death over sinning against our Lord.\\n\\nYou have been sealed! That is a kingly stamp of declaration that you have been adopted, you have been set, in the righteous and perfect decree of the King, as an heir with Christ to the Kingdom of God. In this Kingdom, where God is, there cannot be any sin or unclean things. Do you act like one who has been sealed to be a citizen of the Kingdom?\\n\\nAnd so, if you have known such love from God to be set apart and to not desire to grieve the Spirit, how can you not love the other members of the Church with whom you will spend all eternity with? They too have been sealed?\\n\\nWill you show “wrath and anger and clamor and slander [...] along with malice” (verse 31) against your own brothers and sisters? If we have a common Father who we have inherited all good things from, mustn’t we spend it and share it with those of whom we have been called to serve and love? We have been shown love and now we must show it with all our doings and words.\\n\\nYou see, we cannot help but be “kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another” (verse 32) because in the love of Christ, we have been forgiven.\\n\\nSo, let us be “angry and do not sin” (Ephesians 4:26), as our Father also is angry with sin to the point of satisfying His anger on the cross (Romans 5:9).

A true king is not one who “lord over” his subjects but rather one who becomes a servant to all (Matthew 20:25-28). Our True King, Christ, showed this to us that we may become His “imitators” (verse 1).\\n\\nWe are to be children of the God who rules all things and decrees all things to the point of serving the undeserving sinners who rebelled against His Kingdom!

Of course, we may have dry seasons and we may slip up sometimes, but we must still walk in the light. \\n\\nWhat does “walking as children of the light” look like? Verse 9 gives a very clear answer: to walk in goodness, in righteousness, and in truth. We must also “try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.” We are often faced with decisions in life that do not have specific guidance from the Bible. In the face of such decisions, it is natural to weigh certain factors like the effect on our relationships, the effect on our schoolwork, etc. But our greatest allegiance in these decisions must be to pleasing God.\\n\\nThis can lead to “decision paralysis,” where we are so unsure in our actions because we do not know the path that is most pleasing to God. It should go without saying that we must first seek counsel from the Bible and then from the brothers and sisters around us. But even after all that, we are so often left unsure of what to do. \\n\\nPaul Washer responded to this dilemma like this: imagine a child going outside with his father after a snowstorm. The father leaves footprints as he walks along the snow, with strides far bigger than that of his child. The child is determined to walk in the footprints of his father despite it being difficult for him, having to jump to each footprint. The child may fall while trying to do so. He may miss a few of his father’s footprints. But to anyone watching, no matter how many times the child falls, it is clear as day that the only desire of the child is to walk as his father did. It should be the same for our lives. We may make the wrong decisions, and we may fall down sometimes. But through all these things, we must be fixated on pleasing God and living like Jesus did. \\n\\nIt does not stop at living in the light. We must also realize that this means that we “take no part” in the darkness. In fact, we are called to “expose” the deeds of darkness in verse 11. This does not mean that we look down in condemnation or in hatred on others. Rather, by how we live and what we say (as children of the light), we are called to expose the darkness. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, this is what it means to walk in the light and to expose the darkness. This is a much greater calling than to simply get uncomfortable when a sexual conversation arises, or to limit our alcohol consumption, or to just be kind to others.  We are called to advance the Kingdom and to have no tolerance for sin!\\n\\nIt is easy to read all of this and to become unsure of whether we can really walk in this manner. When this happens, we must remember that we are not called to walk in our own light, but in the light of Christ. It is Christ that empowers us. It is Christ that shines upon us (verse 14) and enables us to live as children of the light.\\n\\nSo “awake, O sleeper”! Stop spending mindless hours playing video games and scrolling through TikTok. Stop living in the darkness of pornography, bitterness, and drunkenness. Let us live as who we are. Let us live as children of the light. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Are you in the light or in the darkness?\\n2. Do you simply tolerate sin, or do you stand boldly in its opposition?

It is crucial for us to understand what it is that Jesus has done for us and what we now enjoy in Him. And Paul goes into it briefly here. \\n\\nFirst, Paul starts off by talking about the redemption through Jesus’s blood. Redemption means to be bought with a ransom from captivity. And the only thing that could pay such a cost was the blood of Jesus. We are bought from slavery into slavery before God. \\n\\nThis points to a critical truth: we are always slaves of something. We like to think that we are in control of our own lives, and we often do everything we can to hold onto this sense of control. But the reality is that until we are ransomed by His blood (v. 7), we are always slaves to our sin. When we are ransomed, we are no longer slaves to sin. That is not our identity anymore, and let not the enemy tell us otherwise. \\n\\nPaul then talks about the forgiveness of our sins. This means to have our debt cancelled, and we can only have our debt cancelled because of Jesus. It is nothing that we did, which is why it is according to His grace. That is why Paul starts this entire section with “in Him.”\\n\\nWe must realize our own helplessness to save ourselves to truly appreciate the grace that God has shown to us. When we understand this, we always have a reason to rejoice. Even in this season of sickness and change, we can truly give thanks for the grace that we have been shown. \\n\\nFurthermore, this was not an arbitrary forgiveness or something that God decided to do at some point in our lives. Paul makes it clear that God set forth this plan that has been perfectly fulfilled through Jesus; God has made His plan of salvation clear through Jesus. \\n\\nThere is something important we must understand here: the Bible is not about us! All of it points to Jesus, all of it is about Jesus, and all of it is fulfilled in Jesus. There is nothing more to gain. Nothing more to get. And we must live in this truth, that we have it all in Christ. Then, no matter what is gained or lost in this world is completely overshadowed by what we have in Jesus, who is the fulfillment of all things. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do we live as those that have been bought with a price, as those that were redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ Himself? \\n\\n2. How should we live as those who have found it all in Christ? How should we approach our schoolwork, jobs, and relationships?

But how exactly do we walk in this manner? Paul gives two answers in today’s passage:\\n\\n1) Walking in Wisdom: Paul is very clear in verses 15-17 that we must walk in wisdom by “making the best use of the time” and “understanding what the will of the Lord is.” This is much more than a call to productivity in our schoolwork and the other tasks that we have for the day.  This is a call to be productive in the eyes of the Lord; that is, to do His will and to advance His kingdom!\\n\\nWe must realize that each second we continue to enjoy on this earth is a gift from the Father. However, this gift is not “free,” as we cannot do whatever we want with it. Instead, we will all give an account to God for how we spend this time (Romans 14:12). At that moment, the only matter of importance will be whether we did the “will of the Lord” or not. Brothers and sisters, let us live today for His kingdom and for His will, not for our own wills and our own agendas. \\n\\nIt is interesting to note that the default is to be unwise and we are now called to live as wise instead. Similarly, the days are defaultly evil, and we are now called to use them for good (verse 16). When we simply go through the day without even a thought to offer it to the Lord, we are stuck in the “default setting” of living as unwise. This morning, let us commit this day to the Lord and “live not as unwise, but wise.” \\n\\n2) Being Filled with the Spirit: We are called to “not get drunk with wine,” but be “filled with the Spirit” (verse 18). As you might expect, this principle is not just exclusive to wine. We musn’t seek fulfillment in anything this world has to offer, from successful careers and loving families to League of Legends rankings. Rather, we must be “filled with the Spirit.” \\n\\nBut what does being filled with the Spirit mean? Here, Paul is talking about being filled with the joy and the hope that comes from the promises of God and from God Himself. This joy overflows into “addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs” and “singing and making melody to the Lord” (verse 19). No matter the happiness (and disappointment) we have found in alcohol, relationships, or success, the fulfillment that comes from the Spirit is much greater than all of these things. \\n\\nFurthermore, being filled with the Spirit is not a personal matter that is kept to oneself. We see in verse 19 that it leads to “addressing one another in psalms and hymns” and in verse 21 that it leads to “submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.” The fullness of the Spirit is so great that it overflows into the lives of others and empowers us to serve them.\\n\\nThis morning, let us long to be filled with the Spirit. Let David’s confession be our own, that “as a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God” (Psalm 42:1). Then, we can walk as children of light.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you offer your days to Lord? \\n2. In what do we seek our greatest fulfillment and satisfaction?

Because they have “no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God” (verse 5). Those who do not walk in the love of God to be imitators of God are those who practice “sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness” (verse 3). Those who do not know God and are not in Christ as the believers are in Christ are naturally sexually immoral in all their thoughts and actions, are impure in their motives and works, and are covetous and idolatrous in all things that they desire.\\n\\nLet us start with sexual immorality. What is sexual immorality? This world has made sex, sexual imagery, and sexual language commonplace in all that we do in modern society. The most popular of swear words is a slang term for “to have sexual intercourse,” the most popular of movies and shows contain one or more forms of sexual imagery,  and the most popular and desirable thing that society has placed in any relationship seems to be sex.\\n\\nWhy is this something that belongs to the “sons of disobedience” (verse 6) and not to the “saints” (verse 3)? It is simply because at the root of it all is the humanist expansion of the worship of man. Sexual immorality is the practice of sex, in all its many spectacles, in a way that is not pleasing to the eyes of God and is mar against the image of God. Sex was supposed to be beautiful — representing the union of two into one, yet it has become a human-elevating form of mere hedonistic pleasure. When there is a sexually immoral action performed, including even just watching pornography or thinking lustful thoughts (and this includes even thinking dreamily about some half-naked figure in a popular movie), we are essentially poiting our eyes away from God and worshipping what God has created, rather than the Creator.\\n\\nSex is mentioned by Paul because is the most potent form of understanding unity. By practicing it immorally, there is a fundamentally destructive art of disunity that forms that merely puts on the sheep’s skin of unity. It is detestable to God because unity can only be achieved in God, yet people now seek it in self-worship of hedonistic pleasure.\\n\\nThe Christian must not practice sex in such a way, but as an act of worship that truly represents unity that we talked so much about in the past chapter. Sexual activities are meant to be between a man and a woman within the confines of marriage as the marriage shows Christ’s devotion to us, and the sex itself shows the oneness of two in one.\\n\\nNext is “impurity” — uncleanness. What does this even mean? When something is impure, it is defiled by something. It is filled with filth that does not allow it to achieve the original purpose for which it was made. The Israelites are given many ritualistic cleansing laws and sacrificial systems to themselves of this impurity both physically and morally. A bowl that was made for eating cannot be used if it is filled with excrement that prevents proper usage of the bowl — the bowl must be completely washed out. An impurity within an individual is anything both sin and weight (Hebrews 12:1) that does not allow that individual to accomplish the purpose for which they were made — to worship God.\\n\\nIf a person’s mind is filled with the desires of the flesh, and are unclean with the practices of satisfying the flesh, it is impossible to please God. It is impossible to desire the right things, to do the right things, and therefore will only continue in the evil of the impurities present.\\n\\nA Christian ought not to do so. The Christian must cast aside all the desires of the world that cling so heavily so as to make every action we commit, and thought that we think to be committed to our vessel-purpose of serving the Lord. No longer do we worship ourselves and our desires of the flesh to bring about the unclean fleeting satisfaction of the flesh, but we purify ourselves daily with the blood of Christ, worshipping the one who has provided such purity for us through His own purity.\\n\\nFinally, we have covetousness. Covetousness is the desire and envy to be ahead, to be better. It is looking to the side and behind us to see how far we come according to the standards of this world. It results in looking to the fellow humans around us and saying, “I just need to arrive at that point to be happy” or saying, “I am at least better than that guy” — it is again, the worship of humanity and the human standards of success.\\n\\nYet, this is not the way of the Christian, for we have only one way to look — towards Christ! He is the one who went before us and endured all for us (Hebrews 12:2). We compare not to others as they are merely human but we compare to the Christ who is God! Within our hearts He lives and He sets us up before Himself (who is the standard) and shows us to be up to the standard because He has met the standard! Any form of looking to the left or to the right is a man-worship that says, “I have yet to meet a standard that I desire for myself!” — what foolishness!\\n\\nAll three of these Paul sums up quite simply as idolatry. In verse 5, Paul says “that is, an idolater” and this points to the three types of people that come before in the same verse. These three people are not three separate people — they are one! It is any sinner not in Christ, a “son of disobedience,” that is an “idolater” who can be sexually immoral, impure, or/and covetous. Paul is making a singular comparison between the “saint” and the “son of disobedience” — all those who are not in Christ are idolaters of themselves.\\n\\nAnd so, the Christian is to lift up thanksgiving for we have been given a new life, rescued from these sins (verse 4). We do not return and act as if we are still our old selves by speaking false, unrighteous talks as listed in verse 4, but we look to God in thanksgiving and act out our gratitude by being workers for Christ.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us truly not be deceived by this world. For their words are “empty words” that hold no power over those of us in Christ (verse 6). We are the inheritors of “the kingdom of Christ and God”, and we have all our identity in being a citizen of it! We can fight the idolatry of the self for we have been delivered from “the wrath of God” (verse 6). Let us remember and sin no more!\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How have we committed idolatry so freely recently?\\n2.

He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. 33 However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nPaul begins Ephesians 5 by calling Christians to be imitators of God. Brothers and sisters, we often profess our desire to be more like Christ, but do we remember why?\\n\\nWhy imitate God? Simply put, it is for our good. By God’s grace, we understand that not imitating God would be following a sin that corrupts us (Eph. 4:22). Who are we if we are not in communion with Christ but an abomination to the Lord? To live is Christ (Phil. 1:21)! Knowing this, we imitate God because we love and treasure everything about him: his Gospel, his Kingdom, and all of his character. In fact, such a God has made us in his image for the very purpose of imitating Him for his glory. Would we not misrepresent our God but become his image; just as an idol compels the pagan to worship its god, would we as image bearers live in such a way to cause others to worship our God. We can only do this if we strive to imitate Him as beloved children (Eph. 5:1). \\n\\nIn marriage, there is a unique and God-glorying calling to imitate Christ’s loving headship as the husband. As Paul continues to explain the mystery of marriage, he clearly states in verse 25, “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her”. Men, this is your priority in marriage - do not take the idea of the love of Christ lightly! Christ loved the Church and this love was an unconditional love. Christ fully knew us in our brokenness and faithlessness and loved us nonetheless unto Calvary. Look to your wife with this same unconditional love, knowing her completely yet loving her for who she is. It is loving her even when she sins against you, fails you, and makes things difficult for you that makes such love unconditional. There will be fruitful seasons of harmony, but there will also be trails that will teach you what is the love and grace of Christ. Be sanctified, and love your wife as Christ loved the Church! \\n\\nPaul gives us an idea of how Christ loved his bride so that husbands can better imitate him. First, as discussed yesterday, Paul describes who Christ is with respect to the Church. Christ is the head of the church, meaning he is its servant leader, who takes initiative and bears responsibility. Likewise, husbands are to be the head of the wife (Eph. 5:22), taking initiative so that she may flourish, for it is his responsibility. Though Eve may have been first to sin, God asked Adam “where are you?” (Gen. 3:9) - for Adam, in his headship, bore the responsibility of sin. Adam’s headship led to death, but we look to Christ’s headship, which led to life. Christ’s sacrifice demonstrated this as he took the lead to save his bride and suffer for her. It was not the Church that planned for its salvation, but Christ, who decisively took the initiative to leave his throne in Heaven to rescue his bride. Husband, be the one to take charge and the first to go up against the enemy, even if it costs you your life.\\n\\nHow does Christ love his Church? First, verse 25 says that he “gave himself up for her”. Christ died for our protection so that we may be saved from the wrath of God (Rom. 5:9). In the same way, husbands are called to protect his wife and children and preserve the life of the family. Secondly, verse 26 says that Christ did this to “sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word”. Husbands, beyond providing for physical needs, be sure to nourish your wife with spiritual bread daily, through encouragement and guidance from the Word of God, which is the work of Christ. Paul then says in verse 27 that Christ made the Church so that she “might be holy and without blemish”. In the same way, would your every action be for the blessing of your wife so that she can be all that God calls her to be. Oh, what good news it is that just like how the wife flourishes under the plan of the husband, we as Christians can follow the plan of our Bridegroom knowing that one day we would appear in perfection, pure and without blemish! Love your wife, and bless her in remembrance of this! \\n\\nFinally, Paul says in verse 28 that “husbands should love their wives as their own body”. We think of our bodies daily; we constantly feed it and never leave it unattended. Let us imitate Christ as he in verse 29 “nourishes and cherishes” the Church. Husband, make sure that the needs of your wife are met and nourish her with prayer. Do not forget to cherish her too! The love of Christ is not mechanical nor lifeless - what a friend we have in Jesus! Be a good friend to your wife: know her, make memories with her, and strive not to be roommates, but soulmates! We see this deep harmony of love in verse 31 as Paul references Genesis 2:24, “Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh”. This union of husband and wife is inexplicably special. It is bound by the power of God, and no man should separate it (Mark 10:9). Do not forget that God planned out marriage before the foundation of the world to be a witness to the Gospel. Enjoy this union and enjoy this Gospel! \\n\\nNow, men of God, consider marriage as rewarding but consequential. Are you ready for this, or do you need to step up? Your wife is called to submit to you, and so you are called to have a leadership your wife can honor. Seek hard after the Lord, and grow in your knowledge and love of Him constantly, praying daily and understanding what needs to be done. Give no opportunity to the devil (Eph. 4:27). Do not dishonor your wife, but more importantly, do not dishonor the Lord. In marriage, we have the unbelievable privilege to witness the Gospel to the dying world. Far be it from us to display heresy. How wretched would it be if we showed in our marriage that Christ puts down his bride, or that Christ does not shepherd his bride, or that Christ deserts his bride. No! Instead, we show that Christ loved his bride unconditionally unto death and so she finds joy in submitting everything to Him. \\n\\nLeadership in marriage is not easy, but remember that Christ has gone before you and will empower you through the Holy Spirit. Count it all joy, for in those difficult days you will be sanctified to be more like Christ. So take up your cross and follow him (Matt. 16:24). \\n\\nChristians, in Christ we have the perfect example of both submission and headship. Let us continue to look to Him and imitate Him not only in marriage but in everything that we do! \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What are you really looking for in marriage? What excites you about marriage and does it match with what the Bible teaches? Is there anything you may need to adjust in your mindset?\\n2. Men, are you ready to take the role of husband? Looking ahead, in what ways must you step up? Women, do the men you desire match the qualities of a Godly husband? \\n3. When the world looks at you, what are you an image of? Pray that you may imitate and reflect God above all else."},"name":"day34"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Ephesians 5:22-24: Submission to the Head\\nApril 24, 2020\\n\\n22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, one incredible privilege the Spirit gives us is the desire to elevate the Lord and others through our submission. What a beautiful thing it is that we, who were once dead in our self-assertive, self-seeking desires (Eph 2:3), were made alive in Christ, becoming a person who joyfully blesses others in submission!\\n\\nUnderstanding the idea of submission is so important that after Paul tells us Christians to submit to one another, he spends another 21 verses discussing it within specific contexts. But before looking at any example of submission, let us remember why submission is a good gift that God calls us to embrace. \\n\\nAll Christians are called by God to practice submission (Eph 5:21) and so it must be for our good (Deut 6:24). But why? First, we remember that it is because of our complete submission to God that we found a lasting joy and life in Christ. Through submission, we may reign with Him. Secondly, it must be good because it is part of who God is. The Father and Son are equal, yet the Son is eternally in submission to his Father (1 Cor. 15:28) in a way that is perfectly loving and harmonious. Thirdly, we were made to bear the image of God. God designed us in love and gave us such a high privilege of mimicking His character. But if God is three Persons, how can we truly bear his trinitarian image without thinking about how we must act with one another? We cannot fully glorify God without enjoying the unique love of submission that is found within His character. Finally, submission teaches us how to prosper in the Kingdom of God, where the greatest is like the youngest and the leader as one who serves (Luke 22:26-27). \\n\\nYet it is often difficult in our flesh to find such joy in submission. But praise God that the Holy Spirit is our helper! Let us wholeheartedly seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit so that we may be able to glorify God through submitting to one another. \\n\\nNow, in verses 22-24, Paul addresses a unique and glorious example of submission exhibited by the wife in marriage. Paul later says in verse 29 that the “mystery” of marriage is explained by Christ and the Church. Marriage is no accident nor is it an arbitrary social institution. It was designed to reflect something about God’s character and God’s heart and the Gospel that cannot be reflected in any other way. God planned out marriage from the beginning of time to reflect the Gospel. Adam’s headship and Eve’s submission existed before the fall. We see here that even before Christ came to rescue his Church, in Genesis, God was already using marriage to describe his covenantal love for the us. It truly points to how God chose us in him before the foundation of the world and predestined us for adoption (Eph. 1:4-5)! The marriage of husband and wife has always been a witness to the Gospel. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us remember that marriage is a platform to display the Gospel of Christ and the Church. Because Christ so lovingly died for the Church, the Church so willingly submits to His lordship. Would we not confuse or obscure the meaning of this in our marriages but rather embrace our complementary roles! \\n\\nWomen of God, you are equal with men in your value, competence, mutual interdependence, sinful nature, and salvation by grace. You are chosen and treasured by God; in being the wife, you are given a role of tremendous influence - embrace such a role with joy! There is a way you shine the glory of Christ that men cannot do as there is a way men shine the glory of Christ that you cannot do. Let each gender use its unique glory for mutual blessing, working together perfectly to display the Gospel for God’s glory. \\n\\nPaul says in verse 24, “now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands”. What does this look like? Biblical submission in marriage requires women to first be in submission to the Lord. When Paul states “as to the Lord” in verse 22, he emphasizes that submission to the husband is part of desiring to please Christ by obeying Christ’s will. Next, biblical submission is recognizing the husband’s headship. Paul writes “the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and he himself is Savior”. The wife must affirm it even if the husband himself refuses his headship, for his role is not by choice but rather by design. Since the husband is the head, he initiates; the wife does not act before the husband or independently of him. Instead, she must be totally loyal to her husband, encouraging, helping, and supporting him with her many gifts in grace and strength. Brothers and sisters, recognize that under a biblical headship, the wife will thrive! \\n\\nAlthough Paul calls wives to submit “in everything”, it is crucial to acknowledge that she must not follow the husband into anything against the will of Christ. The wife should not submit if the husband expects the wife to sin, is mentally incapacitated, is abusive and endangers the family, or commits adultery. Nor does “in everything” mean saying “yes” to every demand, for doing so would foster the husband’s laziness and irresponsibility. Rather, “in everything” means full submission in thoughts, words, and deeds, actively seeking to influence the husband so that he may grow to better mimic Christ as the head. \\n\\nIn a biblical marriage, the wife does not live in fear, nor is passive, nor stifles her spiritual gifts. Instead, by the help of the Spirit, she follows the will of Christ in spiritual strength, wholeheartedly yielding to her husband to demonstrate the Gospel. \\n\\nIf we are to demonstrate an Earthly picture of the Gospel through our marriages, let us not commit heresy! Many marriages follow traditionalism which leads to an unbiblical abuse culture. Christ never put down his bride! On the other hand, many marriages follow a heretical individualism that considers gender differences inconsequential. But the Church finds joy only through surrendering the self in full submission to Christ! The latter view is particularly strong at Princeton. However, let us not argue over which misrepresentation of marriage is worse or deserves greater attention. Let us instead fix our eyes on the Gospel and in unity, speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15), firmly opposing anything that is contrary to the Word (Eph. 4:25).  \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us consider Christ, who perfectly submitted to the Father’s will, and seek after such a submission with one another so that we can better know Him, love Him, and glorify Him.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What is your attitude towards submission? Is it filled with resentment or filled with great joy? In what ways have you submitted to others, especially during this unique time?\\n2.

These pieces of armor are ones that would have been very familiar to the Ephesians, as they were worn by the Roman soldiers all around them. Just as no soldier was without their armor, we are all called to put on this armor of God to fight against the enemy.\\n\\nHowever, we mustn\'t simply see this armor as a list of spiritual disciplines that are to be learned and practiced. Of course, it is very insightful to break down each piece of the armor of God and the purpose that it serves (a good resource is John MacArthur’s sermon series on this). However, that is not the focus of today’s devotional nor is it the main focus of today’s passage! \\n\\nYou see, the armor of God is not a list of steps to become a better Christian. The armor of God is exactly that: God’s armor. It is not our own. It is the very armor that was worn by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when He took the stand against sin and death, and we see it throughout the Old Testament. \\n\\nFor example, Isaiah 59:17 says that God is the one who “puts on righteousness as a breastplate, and helmet of salvation on His head.” Isaiah 11 speaks of the coming One of whom “righteousness will be His belt.” This is not just any armor that we are called to put on; it is the armor of God!\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, this is how we know that we can stand under the weight of this world, full of sin and temptation. It is not because we have a secret formula to do so but because we know that this armor has already been tried and tested and has come out victorious. So therefore take heart, for Jesus has given this armor to all who believe. \\n\\nThe issue at hand, then, is whether or not we will accept this calling and put on this armor. As Paul said in Ephesians 4:1, we are now called to walk in a manner worthy of this calling, worthy of this armor worn by the Glorious One. Just as there was not a single Roman soldier without his armor, all of us are called to put on this armor and fight this battle. And we do not pick and choose the days that we want to fight for the Kingdom. We are called to fight until the war is over or until He calls us home. Just as the Israelites who were cowering on the sidelines ran forth to fight the Philistines after David killed Goliath, so too must we run forth in the victory of our Lord over sin and death. \\n\\nOur Savior has not left us in this world empty-handed and hopeless, so let us not live as though we are! Instead, let us bow our knees before the Father today and ask again that today, He make us more like Jesus. \\n\\nAs a final thought, let us sing this children’s hymn this morning, and may it be our prayer:\\n\\nStand up, stand up for Jesus! ye soldiers of the cross;\\nLift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss:\\nFrom vict’ry unto vict’ry, His army shall He lead,\\nTill every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.\\n \\nStand up, stand up for Jesus! The trumpet call obey:\\nForth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day;\\nYe that are men now serve Him against unnumbered foes;\\nLet courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.\\n \\nStand up, stand up for Jesus! Stand in His strength alone,\\nThe arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;\\nPut on the gospel armor, and watching unto prayer,\\nWhere calls the voice of duty, be never wanting there.\\n \\nStand up, stand up for Jesus! the strife will not be long;\\nThis day the noise of battle, the next the victor’s song;\\nTo him that overcometh a crown of life shall be;\\nHe with the King of glory shall reign eternally.\\n \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

Paul made it very clear that the relationship of the wife to the husband should be that of the Church to Christ. This showed that every relationship that we see on earth are not mere standalone connections that exist for its own sake, but are God-inspired institutions for the purposes of showing more of God.\\n\\nSimilarly, the relationship between the parent and the child extends to more than the individuals apparently involved and points to the divine relationship of God to Himself and God to us, His creation bearing the image of God.\\n\\nPerhaps as students in college who return home each summer (and now a bit earlier and for longer due to the predicaments), this concept of honoring our parents is something we started to think about more extensively. What does this commandment (verse 2; Exodus 20:12) look like for those who no longer really live at home with their parents and are transitioning for their care into the “real world”? As we become adults, how are we to continue to “honor” our parents?\\n\\nThese questions concerning the commandment of Exodus 20:12 (aka the fifth of the Ten Commandments), reiterated in the second verse of our passage, is quite simply answered by Paul in the first verse of our passage.  You see, the second verse, “honor your father and mother,” was given by Paul to explain the reason why we must do the first verse of obeying our parents. In such a way, Paul reduces the command of honoring our father and mother into the equally singular command of “obey your parents in the Lord” (verse 1).\\n\\nThe word for “obey” here means “to be under the authority of” and also means “to hear attentively to” — it does not mean a mere begrudging carrying out of tasks because we are forced to do so, but rather it requires an agreement to and a willing heart to follow your parents. It means to desire and love to do what they desire.\\n\\nHow can we do this? I don’t think there is one individual who can honestly testify that they have not held a moment in their lives detesting their parents, have not thought ill against their parents, or have not disagreed or disobeyed their parents. Yet, we know God to be someone who desires perfection (Matthew 5:48). And so naturally, we do not look to another human being who is as fallen as any of us, but we look to the Son of God for the proper course of action. We look to Jesus.\\n\\nJesus was the perfect practitioner of the fifth commandment. On earth, He did all that the Father desired (John 5:19) and does it all under the authority of the Father (John 8:28). He did this to the point of death (Matthew 28:39). Not only that, but He still awaits in heaven, standing for us until that last day when we will come to Him as His Bride (Matthew 24:36).\\n\\nWhat we should take away from the work of Jesus in His perfect example of submission to the Father is not that if we work hard enough, we can achieve a perfect obedience to our parents — such would be an act of legalism. Rather, it means that, by looking to Jesus, we understand what it means to obey our parents “in the Lord” (verse 1, emphasis added). You see, just as Paul explained to the husband to look to the wife as Christ looked to the Church, we are to look to our parents as Christ looks to the Father. We are to understand that if Christ’s perfect obedience is to be reflected in our work of loving our parents and obeying them best we could, we do it in our greater desire to follow Christ and to shine Christ in all manners of our lives.\\n\\nIn the Lord, we obey our parents knowing that it is an act of worship that shouts to the world of the obedience of Christ unto the cross. And we all know what kind of obedience was shown to the world on that cross, on that Calvary hill.\\n\\nThis is reflected in the third verse of our passage: “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land”. This was the blessing given with the commandment (as our verse 2 shows) and it communicates the fullness of obedience required to stay in our Father’s goodness. As we obey our parents, we come to see how we must obey the Father, and therefore become deserving of blessings He offers to those who are perfect. As we, the Church, have been deemed perfect by our Father, we are recipients of that blessing, and as we observe our obedience to our fathers and mothers, we realize our blessings.\\n\\nAnd if Christ’s perfect obedience to the Father was to be reflected by the child’s obedience to his parents, then the Father’s perfect goodness and instruction to Christ should be reflected in the parents’ loving care and instruction to their children as verse 4 shows. Parents, if they are to expect obedience from their children, are to bring up the children “in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” (verse 4).\\n\\nYet, we know that parents don’t quite get it right, as we also do not obey our parents when we ought to. Does this mean that we should ignore our parents and disobey them? No! Obey them to your greatest ability as long as your obeying them shows and reflects Christ’s Gethsemane cry (Matthew 26:39). This means that as long as they are requiring of you something that does not go against the Word of God, follow them even if it is something you’d rather not do. This is hard — and yet we know following Christ is harder.\\n\\nThis is a command to “children” — meaning in the original language, “descendent, child” — has no regard to age necessarily. As long as we are our parent’s children, we are to listen and honor them. Solomon did so with David, Isaac with Abraham, and Sham and Japheth with Noah — not to mention the eternal Son to the Father. This means, we, college students, must do the same.\\n\\nObedience to our parents is not some “cherry on top” that is desirable if we want to receive blessings. For the Christian, it is actually a practice of worship that glorifies God and reveals more of our already-received blessing in Christ — to not be set apart by our obedience would be sinful.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us reflect Christ in every corner of our lives — especially in the harder tasks such as obeying our parents to honor them.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you obey your parents? How can you obey them better? Do you need to apologize to them for your misconduct in the past couple of weeks?\\n2. Does your actions in obedience to your parents show Christ’s obedience to the Father?\\n3. When is the last time you asked your parents what they wanted?

You may have colored in the armor color-by-number sketched in Sunday school or may have read about it when you were younger and thought about a knight in shining armor battling the enemies.\\n\\nA recurring theme that Paul presents in his letters is an imagery of the Kingdom of God against the forces of evil who are attacking the saints. Paul, I believe, being trained and raised up in the Jewish faith, knew very well the physical realities of violence that translated in full to the realities of the not seen — the spiritual realm. The battle between flesh and spirit, the battle between evil and good are illustrated in both Paul’s language that are the painting brushstrokes of a battleground that Christ has already conquered (we see throughout the Old Testament battles fought where God defeats the enemy and Israelites merely rout them) and also in the metaphors that he employs to better accustom the mind of the readers to the not seen by using examples of the seen.\\n\\nIn today’s passage, we see the image of the “armor of God” (verse 11). We will see in detail what each of these parts of the armor do and how they are inspired by the Roman armor tomorrow, but for today, we can see why we must put on such an armor.\\n\\nWe are soldiers for Christ (2 Timothy 2:3-4). We are the legionaries who stand arm in arm with shields interlocked and our gladii strapped to our legs. We, the Church, like a legion works in one effort, mind, and goal. We, the Body, eat together, rest together, and fight together.\\n\\nPaul, looking at the Roman soldiers who are dominating all the region around the Mediterranean Sea, knows what discipline, control, and single-minded will the legions of the Roman military have in their strength to defeat the enemies of the Roman empire. And hence, he wants to show that to “be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might” (verse 10), we must “Put on the whole armor of God” (verse 11). The Roman soldiers and their state-issued armor announced with pride the might and glory of Rome. When the Roman legion marched into conquered regions in perfect unison, the conquered people did not merely see a rag-tag group of scarcely clad armor, but they marveled at an army adorned and dressed with the finest armor carrying the insignia of their republic — “SPQR”. If their armor had dents and scratches, they merely testified of both the tenacity of the soldiers and the head of the empire.\\n\\nHow much greater is the Kingdom of God? We are to be strong “in the Lord and in the strength of his might” (verse 10). The Roman Empire was mighty, and strong, yes, but they did not compare to the might of our Lord Jesus Christ. We see a picture of this in Revelations 19:13-16 and from here we see the King and Conqueror who leads the final battle. We can be stronger than any nation on earth because His empire is not the pond of the Mediterranean Sea, but the vastness of the universe — and that’s an understatement.\\n\\nSo, if we are to be strong in our God, how are we to do so? Firstly, as we see in verse 11, we put on the armor of God. Why? Because we are part of His Kingdom — a soldier without the coat of arms, without the insignia, without the stamp of their lord is a soldier to be slain in battle. Furthermore, it is so that we “may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil” (verse 11). For we do not have a Lord who will send us stripped and vulnerable into the thicket of battle — once we have been stripped of the enemy’s garments of evil and sin, upon us are put on His armor (of which we will go into detail tomorrow). Furthermore, this armor that is put on us is fit for the battle that is at hand for us. As the Romans were to put on armor that was fit for the battle of the climate, God gives us armor that is fit for the climate of our battles. Our battle “to stand against the schemes of the devil” (verse 11).\\n\\n“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.” (verse 12). Perhaps I need not say any further to describe what we are fighting against as Paul does a sufficient job! Rather, here I will summarise and clarify (in all honesty, that is all I do!)\\n\\nHere, Paul is not enumerating a list of different beings we are at war against. As we can see, Paul is further clarifying his prior point with each proceding phrase. Let us follow his argument. “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood” — so what do we fight against? We fight “against the authorities” — wait, who has authority? They are “the cosmic powers over this present darkness” — cosmic powers? Like stars and planets? No, no, they are “the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” — oh I see, “the devil” from verse 11.\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed my little internal dialogue.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, we are soldiers. Not just lone soldiers without a lord or a master, but soldiers of the greatest army in existence, nay, imaginable. Let us truly put on that armor and be joyful to know that the War is won. Let us put on the armor that identifies us as Christ’s and gives us the defense in accordance to that identity.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

Though the last chapter is coming to a close, let us not read it as if Paul is easing out to transition into closing remarks; rather, let us read these few verses as the final crescendo of Paul’s epic exhortation. There are formidable rulers and authorities and powers of Satan that are against us and we must soldiers equipped with the armor of God. Yet as soldiers we are nothing without the voice of the Commander. If we are to win spiritual battles, and if we are to be connected to the power of God, we must pray! \\n\\nPrayer is the breath of the Christian life. In the words of John Piper, it is the “wartime walkie-talkie”. Brothers and sisters, do we recognize that we are surrounded by spiritual warfare or do we come at life with a dull and blind complacency? We often do not pray because we forget that communicating with the Commander is the difference between victory and defeat. \\n\\nPaul urges us to see our desperate need to constantly pray. He tells us in verse 18 that we must pray “at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication” and “keep alert with all perseverance”. To Paul, prayer is truly like taking a spiritual breath: to run the race we must continually pray, pray, pray. That is why he tells us to do it with “all perseverance” - would we need to have perseverance if we only prayed when we “felt like” doing so? No! We must aim to pray every chance we can get, with “all prayer”; let us have our silent prayer, shouting prayer, groaning prayer, fervent prayer, and kneeling prayer all be part of our constant prayer. We can only see this constant need to pray if we “keep alert” with eyes set on spiritual things. Indeed, prayer is important, but Paul emphasizes that it must be “in the Spirit”. Our prayers must not be meditating aimlessly or selfishly in our own thoughts and desires, but rather, they must be with full submission to God, seeking to advance the Kingdom with a heart of glorifying Him.\\n\\nPaul then emphasizes that we must not only pray for ourselves but also for “all the saints”. Let us not forget that we as the Church are one body such that failing to pray for each other means bringing harm unto ourselves. We see in verse 19 that even apostle Paul himself needed intercessory prayer! Paul asks that “words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel”. Let us mimic Paul’s prayer request for it is truly “in the Spirit”; though it pertains to his situation, it clearly aims for nothing but the advancement of the Gospel for God’s glory. As Paul writes this letter, perhaps he is thinking about how he will soon be giving his defense before Caesar. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, no matter where we are, let us press on in constant prayer for ourselves and for each other. And in our prayers, would we learn to pray like Paul, who, though in prison, considers himself an “ambassador in chains”. He cares not about when he will be set free or what pain he may endure but rather how he can take the Gospel and “declare it boldly”! \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What does your prayer life look like?

This can be translated in two ways given the Greek form of the writing: \\n\\n(1) We are made to be an inheritance. That is, we are God’s inheritance to Jesus. We must realize that Jesus has bought us for a price, and we are now His. When we struggle with ideas of self-worth, or when we want to live as we please, let us remember that we were bought with a price. And when we are tempted to hold our brothers and sisters in contempt, let us remember that they, too, were bought with a price. \\n\\nThis is not because of anything that we have done, but because of God’s grace. We only enjoy this in Him. \\n\\n(2) Christ is our inheritance, and everything that He inherits we also inherit. We must realize that we truly have it all in Christ, to no merit of our own, but rather because of God’s grace. There is nothing more to gain than Jesus. \\n\\nNote that in verse 11, Paul says that we have obtained this inheritance, but verse 14 suggests that we have yet to acquire possession of it. How do we make sense of this? This is the common theme of “already, but not yet” in the Bible. It is true that we already have this inheritance, that we belong to Jesus and Jesus belongs to us. However, the inheritance that we have yet to receive is the heavenly inheritance, the unfading crown that we will receive when we come to die. \\n\\nFurthermore, this inheritance is guaranteed, and Paul gives two assuring reasons: \\n\\n(1) God, the One who works all things according to the counsel of his will, actually predestined this inheritance. He did not randomly decide to give it to us, but the unchanging and everlasting God planned this from the start for the praise of His glory. \\n\\n(2) God gives us the Holy Spirit. As we continue to be led by the Spirit, we know that we are the children of God. Our inheritance is confirmed and guaranteed, and we are “sealed.” This means that we are authenticated as God’s possession. And the Holy Spirit dwelling in us is proof to ourselves and to others of this possession. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, we have a great inheritance that can never be lost, for God is unchanging and His Word does not fail. Though promises and guarantees in this world mean little, we can trust in the sovereign God. \\n\\nIn this season of sickness when it seems that everything, such as friends, was swept away in an instant, let us be reminded that earthly possessions rot away, but heavenly possessions can never be lost. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

Paul both begins and ends Ephesians by prayerfully wishing for grace to be with all who read his epistle. This should come as no surprise because we know Paul is a minister of God’s grace (Eph. 3:7). Grace is a defining theme that ties together the book of Ephesians. Paul teaches that we were adopted to praise God’s grace (Eph. 1:6), saved by God’s grace (Eph. 2:5), and were each given a gift of grace (Eph. 4:7) that we are compelled to give to others as we imitate Christ (Eph. 5:1). As we finish the book of Ephesians, let us follow Paul’s wish and continue in God’s grace, both receiving it and providing it.\\n\\nThere are several truths we can glean from Paul’s closing benediction. First, Paul, though in prison, is doing everything he can to encourage the church at Ephesus in love. He not only writes this letter, but we see in verses 21-23 that he also sends his helper Tychicus to be a source of encouragement. During this time, not all of Scripture had been written and likely Tychicus had many stories and teachings from the life of Paul. How lucky it is that we now have access to encouragements and truths that the early church did not have through the book of Acts, all the epistles, and the Gospel! \\n\\nSecondly, Paul wishes in verse 23 that “peace be to the brothers, and love with faith”. The peace here is more than just temporary tranquility from the world, but rather it is from “God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ”. This is crucial, because we know that He himself is our peace, (Eph. 2:14) and there is no true peace apart from being mutually rooted in reconciliation with God. In addition to peace, Paul offers “love with faith”. The word “with” shows us that love and faith are intricately tied together. It mirrors how Paul constantly puts “God the Father” with the “Lord Jesus Christ”. God would not be our Father if Jesus is not our Lord. In the same way, without faith we do not have true love. In Christ, our faith works through love (Gal. 5:6); as John Piper puts it, faith expresses, acts, and works itself by producing love. \\n\\nFinally, Paul wishes that “grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible”. Paul builds upon the idea of “love with faith” by showing that our love is one that is incorruptible. An incorruptible love is one that is both eternal and imperishable, and this can only be possible if it is coming from God. In other words, this love with which we love Christ and each other must come from Christ. Thus, we have this love only when we are with Christ. That is why love and faith are inseparable - for it is faith that unites us to Christ! Let us remember that at times we may have the appearance of love, but whatever does not proceed from faith is sin (Rom. 14:23). \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us continue on in God’s grace, growing in His love and peace through faith. But let us also be careful and constantly examine our fruit, making sure that it is rooted in nothing but God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

One would think that after their exile (which was due to Judah’s unrepentant sin), the Jewish people would have fully repented and be filled with a passion for the Lord. \\n\\nHowever, this was not the case. In fact, the reason that Malachi gives this message is because the people of God were completely apathetic to the Lord. They served God in the temples, but their hearts and their lives did not reflect a fear or love for the Lord. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, herein lies a very important truth. Oftentimes, we think that trials themselves draw us closer to the Lord and refine us. But we see here that after the great exile to Babylon, the people of God still did not have the right hearts in serving the Lord. Rather, it is learning to trust and depend on solely Jesus through these trials that refines us. In this trying time for many of us, let us pray that we do not remain stagnant; instead, let us grow in our love and trust for the Lord. \\n\\nThis book is structured as a series of disputes. First, Malachi or God will make an assertion, and this is followed by a dispute from the people (signaled by the phrase “but you say…”). Then, this challenge is answered by Malachi or God Himself. \\n\\nSomething to note in just this first verse is that the message is addressed “to Israel” (verse 1). This is interesting when you recall that the kingdom of Israel was split into two, Israel and Judah, during the reign of King Rehoboam (son of King Solomon). The message that Malachi gives is actually to the Kingdom of Judah. When calling these people “Israel”, it does not mean the northern kingdom of Israel but rather the people of God as a whole. Therefore, God is saying that the kingdom of Judah has the full promises of the people of God that were promised throughout the Old Testament.  \\n\\nOn a final note, the book of Malachi also paints a picture of the coming Messiah. As we study this book together, let us see how everything truly points to our Savior and King, Jesus Christ. \\n"},"name":"day41"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Malachi 1:2-5: God’s Love and Sovereignty\\nMay 3, 2020\\n\\n\\n2 “I have loved you,” says the Lord.

Israel has been restored though they had been sent into exile for their any sins against the Lord. Yet, from the words recorded by Malachi in verse 2, we can see that Israelites ask “How have you loved us?” to God’s declaration that He has loved Israel. \\n\\n\\nThis is perhaps one of the gravest insults to God any people of God can throw at the loving God of Jacob.\\n\\n\\nThis is Israel. This is the nation chosen, not for any human, utilitarian reason, but for the sake of God’s unsearchable heart of unconditional love for His chosen people (Deuteronomy 7:7).\\n\\n\\nThis is the people who rebelled against God even after having seen the mighty hand of God stretch out over the pharaoh (Exodus 14:11-12). These are the people who complained for water even after seeing the mighty waters of the Red Sea split in half for the Israelites to pass, only for it to swallow in whole the armies of Egypt (Exodus 17:2). This is the nation who committed idolatry even as Moses was coming down from the mountain to gift to the people the Law of the Lord (Exodus 32:1). These are the people who cowered before men to stand in defiance to God when they heard a report of the promised land that looked unfavorable to their blind eyes even with the columns of wind and fire still storming besides them (Numbers 14:2-4). This is the nation that asked for a king when they had the King of Kings reigning over them (1 Samuel 8:7). These are the people who violated all covenants to be expelled into Babylon (2 Chronicles 36:29-21).\\n\\n\\nNow, they have been restored by the Lord despite their many failures (even more that have not been accounted for here). They have been reestablished — the Lord once again dwells in the rebuilt temple (Ezra 6:14-18). They have failed over and over again only for the Lord to come to their rescue. A million times they have struck the Lord, a million times the Lord responded with kindness. Yet, the response God receives is the insolence of “How have you loved us?” (verse 2).\\n\\n\\nTo this unimaginable disgrace and dishonor to the God of the universe, God responds. He responds! — instead of smiting them at the moment of their insolence and deprived sense of right and wrong, this God, the supposed Ruler of All, tones His voice down to that of the volume of man to speak to dust of the earth (Genesis 2:7).\\n\\n\\nHis response must be understood properly for us to have any coherent interpretation of the rest of this book. The Lord explains Himself and says, “Is not Esau Jacob’s brother? [...] Yet I have loved Jacob but Esau I have hated.” (verses 2-3). God is holy, and He is sovereign. This is bad news for sinners like us as it means that in His holiness we are undone — we stand condemned. As all men have sinned (Romans 3:23), all stand condemned as well as wicked people, and those who are wicked, God hates (Psalm 11:5). Therefore, rightfully, God hates all men — yes, all the world. This includes Esau and Jacob as well. Though they were brothers, God chose to love one but not the other. In fact, though they were twins, of the same birth, from the same parents, at the same time, God chose one over the other. God is quite explicit in His hatred as well. He does not stop at “Esau I have hated.” but goes on from verse 3 to 4 talking about the extent of His hatred expressed as well.\\n\\n\\nIf all men are to deserve the same punishment of Esau (and his descendents, the Edomites), why is it that God would choose Israel to be saved from His wrath and anger that they so rightfully deserve?\\n\\n\\nIf any theologian is being perfectly honest, the simplest, and perhaps the most correct response they could give is “I don’t know”. Yes, of course, for the sake of His glory (Psalm 115:1), but why the Israelites? Why the Church? — we simply do not know. And it is good that is is so — for that is why the love of God to us is unconditional. Jacob did not merit it — nay, he deserved the opposite of it, yet God chose him to establish a people who would last all ages.\\n\\n\\nWe, the Church, continue the line of the Israelites. We who were not God’s people have been called “my people” (Romans 9:24-26). We also do not know why we have been elected to be God’s people and to be saved from the wrath of God through the love of God to be presented to the joy of God, yet we do know we are to glorify God. As even our passage today indicates in verse 5, Israel will say “Great is the Lord beyond the border of Israel!”. We are part of that Israel, and we are to recognize the work of Christ that opened the doors to the citizenship of heaven to any nation. We serve a God who is not in need of a nation or a specific people to work, but need only Himself to do all the work of salvation. God has chosen His elect, not because we have come to a “secret knowledge” by our own attainment, nor because we were better than other people, but because God is great enough to love those who stand in opposition to Him.\\n\\n\\nChurch, we once stood condemned before God, yet in His sovereignty and divine election, He knew us before we were even born, and chose us before we were in our mothers’ wombs, to bring us to Himself that we may shout and sing “Great is the Lord beyond the border of Israel!”. Will we truly do that as we live out another day in the light of our Lord?\\n\\n\\nIf we are truly the elect, the House of Israel, let us not evoke to anger the Lord our unconditional lover as Judah had done, but let us, in the words recorded by Isaiah, “O House of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.” (Isaiah 2:5).\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Have we ever thanked the Lord for choosing us despite our unfit nature?\\n2. How have the Lord spared us and loved us despite our many failures? What are some failures and sins we have committed before God that He graciously loved us through? How can we not commit them again but glorify God as the people of God we ought?"},"name":"day42"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Malachi 1:6-9: An Evil Worship\\nMay 4, 2020\\n\\n6 “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the Lord of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’ 7 By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying that the Lord\'s table may be despised. 8 When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the Lord of hosts. 9 And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the Lord of hosts.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nIn Ephesians 6, in our devotionals, we talked about the relationships of the parent to the child and also the relationship of the master to the servant. We learned that these relationships are evident and representative of the relationships that we have with our God, Yahweh. These two same relationships are shown once again in today’s passage as the Israelites fail to properly honor the Father, and as they fail to properly fear the Lord (verse 6).\\n\\nThese Israelites know best how to worship the Lord properly in fear and in honor of Him. They have been raised since birth, even since the eighth day (for males) to remember the Lord in virtually all things in their lives. The Torah, the Pentateuch, reveals in great detail the lives of the Israelites from day to day, and how every element of their lives were to be an image of worship to the Lord. Despite this, we see the fallen nature of man take over like an uncontrolled undergrowth in a neglected garden. The Israelites repeat the action of tipping a bucket onto the garden without water, and pull up weed without cutting off the root of the weed. They repeat actions, but do not know who they are intending to worship.\\n\\nWorst yet, these are the priests, those who are to be the teachers of the Law (Deuteronomy 33:10), who have forgotten and neglected proper worship unto the Lord. They despise the name of the Lord, not because they have merely said so, but because they do so in all the ways in which they worship the Lord (verse 7).\\n\\nThe primary way in which they do this is through their offering of polluted food (verse 7). Our God, in no way, shape or form, needs our hand in provision of His sustenance. He is the only one who has aseity — He is self-sustaining. However, He desires sacrifice as it is the statement and snapshot of our hearts at the moment of coming into the presence of God. Whenever an Israelite entered into the presence of God in the tabernacle or the temple, he brought a sacrifice, not to physically appease the Lord, but to show the condition of His heart and to represent the payment he was due to the Creator. God desired sacrifice because in obeying the sacrificial worship, the Israelite was showing His heart for the Lord.\\n\\nYet, we see a polluted sacrifice unto the Lord that is strictly prohibited by God (Leviticus 4). Blind, lame and sick animals are offered to the Lord that one would not even offer unto their governor (verse 8)! The sacrifices to God, if it is to be a reflection of the heart, are to show the utmost dedication that the giver of the sacrifice desires to show God. As David remarks in Psalm 51:16-17, “the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” — God desires the heart, and if the heart you wish to offer is the least of your flock, and the last of your time and effort, what is that to God? It is not your broken spirit you are offering, but the scraps of your table.\\n\\nDo we not also do this? Especially in this time of pandemic when we are forced to offer our sacrifices and worship unto the Lord in front of a computer screen, do we do it with all our hearts? Do we put on our Sunday clothes, sit in front of our desks and act as if we are sitting amongst other saints, the heavenly choir of angels, and with the God of heaven and earth? Or rather, do we sit groggy from a late night with pajamas on and singing in half-asleep consciousness that are blind, lame, and sick with the debaucheries of gaming, movies, and food from yesterday? We would not even dress in such a way and act in such a way with our local government officials or job interviewers or professors!\\n\\nWhat does our worship look like at this time of casting into the fire? We are only touching upon the fire of the Lord in this time of disease. This COVID-19 does not compare to the wrath that we deserve that will be released to all those who are not forensically declared righteous through the saving blood of Christ.\\n\\nTruly, let us “now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us.” (verse 9). His favor was satisfied by the blood of Christ, and the greatest favor of His Fatherhood to us has been granted to us. Would we act as if we are truly children of the living God? Would we treat the most loving Father with such contempt and hatred?\\n\\nO, brothers and sisters, let us love God, because He has loved us first (1 John 4:19).\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Let us repent in all the different ways we have not given worship as we ought to have.\\n2.

For I am a great King, says the Lord of hosts, and my name will be feared among the nations.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n \\nFor the past few devotionals, we have seen the great sin of the Israelites in their lazy offerings to the Lord. What we must understand from this is why the Israelites gave such offerings to God, lest we come to dishonor God in the same way. \\n\\nToday’s passage gives a very simple answer: the Israelites did not fear the Lord. In verse 14, God makes it clear that He mustn’t be dishonored by polluted offerings because He is a “great King” that will be feared. In other words, the Israelites gave such offerings because they did not honor God as such and did not fear Him.\\n\\nBut what does it mean to fear the Lord? This is essential not only in our understanding of today’s passage, but in the entirety of our walk with the Lord. Proverbs 9:10 tells us that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and we are told in Acts 9:31 that the disciples built up the church in the “fear of the Lord.” God Himself commands us to fear Him, so it is crucial that we understand what fearing the Lord means. \\n\\nOne of the clearest pictures of fearing the Lord is in Exodus 33, when God passed by Moses. Imagine how Moses felt at that very moment. The Almighty One, in the fullness of His holiness, glory, love, justice, and greatness was passing by. Surely, Moses would have been filled with awe and wonder, but it goes deeper than that. Had God not safely hid Moses in the cleft of a rock before He passed, he would have died. And yet, since Moses was safely hidden in that cleft, he was able to revere and be in awe of the Lord without the dread of being instantly condemned in God’s holiness and killed. \\n\\nThis, brothers and sisters, is how we must fear the Lord. We are to behold God in all of His greatness and glory and be amazed. We are to know the Lord as the Holy One who searches both mind and deed and fall to our knees in reverence. We are to know the hatred and wrath that God has against sin and tremble. However, we are not to be filled with the dread and terror of being instantly condemned because we are hidden in the cleft that is our Savior, Jesus Christ. \\n\\nWhen we fear the Lord, we appreciate His greatness. And that was the problem of the Israelites. They did not fear the Lord, and they did not see His greatness. That is why Israelites found it wearisome to come before God in verse 13. Something else had captivated their hearts and minds other than this greatness. Perhaps they saw greatness in their wealth and possessions, leading them to offer only the most useless livestock to the Lord. Brothers and sisters, whatever it is, anything that we hold in greater esteem or value than God Himself tells us that we do not fear the Lord as we ought.\\n\\nWe cannot forget who God is, especially in this time. Even as sickness, hardship, and death are more present than ever, we must still fear the Lord above all else and know that He is greater. Only when we fear the Lord and His greatness can we truly trust in Him because we can then trust that God is above all things. \\n\\nThis morning, let us not forget the greatness of God. Let us walk in “fear and trembling” as Philippians 2:12 says, and let us seek to give unto the Lord the honor that He is due. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you fear the Lord?  \\n2. What do you hold the greatest reverence for? \\n3.

He will not look at people who mumble a couple words correctly during prayer, or those who sing a couple notes in correct melody as those who are of His heart. Such debasement of worship is detestable to God, and He, as we read from this passage, has no pleasure from it.\\n\\nSo what shall we do?\\n\\nThe first step is to cease. Cease the worship that is not worship to clear room for the true worship. We need to stop, and “shut the doors” so that we can put out the unauthorized fire (Leviticus 10:1), lest God does it for us. Shall we wait until the Lord breaks apart congregations, locks the church doors, and puts to silence the choirs by a disease such as this current pandemic to prevent offering of our muddied hearts in worship?\\n\\nLet us stop. Let us stop with the modern theologies that put creation above the Creator. Let us stop with the sentimental words and emotion-producing music that all but drown out the groans and moans of the receiver of our worship. Let us clear the air of the incense that is not pleasing to the Lord so that the air would be filled with the Spirit once again.\\n\\nOur God is not a mortal man that He would have mistakenly unleashed a deadly disease upon the nations with force enough to blow shut the doors of churches and homes. He is a God who is furious at the evil of this world in both the secular malls and in the religious churches. All the world is facing the consequences of its wayward heart, but only the Church is rebuked, not punished, for its evils as the Lamb has taken our punishment.\\n\\nSo shall we sit still and wait out the rebuke of the Lord while we continue our ignorant worship? Far be it from us that we would do so. Even when all the world lounges in ignorance, this is when the Church ought to grasp its heart and fall on its knees before the Lord of hosts. Yes, we have more time with family, some of us, and have more free time to do things, some of us, however, all the while, the world is in pain — “all creation waits with eager longing” (Romans 8:19). I hope we would not be those who call “evil good and good evil” (Isaiah 5:20) at this time. Instead, we ought to see the depths of the evils that caused the Lord to remind us once again of our mortality.\\n\\nOnly then, only when we come to see the weeds and thistles growing in our hearts that we had not noticed before, when we see the dark sin polluting the vessel of our being, and once we have repented of such sins to realize how much more the grace of God and the suffering of Christ was in magnitude, shall we offer up sacrifices that are again pleasing to God. Our offerings to God are worth naught if it is not in response to the sacrifice of Christ.\\n\\nThen, let us rejoice, for though while on earth we will never be able to offer perfect sacrifice in our own bodies, we have a Christ who accomplished just that for us. For us the Body, God no longer says “I will not accept an offering from your hand.” If we know that truth and if we have faith in Christ who lived out that truth, let us continually offer up worship that is not polluted to the best of our heart, soul and mind.\\n\\nWhen our Father, the gracious God who has adopted us, has rebuked us, we take it with gratitude and with a heart that seeks to repent. This rebuke, though weighty and burdensome now, will bloom to prepare for us a greater love that He wishes to lavish upon us. Then, we will say, “Ah, why did we ever doubt? Why were we of such little faith? He is truly our Father.”\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, have we permitted the sin of empty worship to impact our lives? Or have we allowed for our worship to be a tainted one that offers only the worst of our efforts to God? If so, let us repent. This is the perfect time to do so!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

While our knee jerk reaction might be to quickly deny this charge, let us examine our lives carefully. Do we joyfully wait in anticipation for Sunday service, where together with our brothers and sisters, we are ushered into the throneroom of God? Or do we act like we can simply “squeeze” God into our schedule? Do we stay up late on Saturday night doing whatever it is we deem important, only to groggily attend church the next day and promptly fall back asleep again? Or even worse, do we only worship and serve the Lord during the Sunday livestreams and the Wednesday/Friday Zoom Bible studies, only to do whatever we want for the rest of the week? \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, do we know who God is? Do we know who it is that we serve? If we truly did, we would see it as an honor and privilege to serve the Lord. If we knew anything about who God is and who we are as sinners, we would fall to our knees in the greatest esteem everytime we come before Him. \\n\\nIt is the “Lord of hosts” that we are serving! It is He whose “name will be great among the nations” (verse 11) that we have the privilege to love and worship! So let us get one thing through our hard heads, brothers and sisters. It is not God who has the privilege to receive our love and affection. Rather, it is us that have the great Honor to serve and love the Lord. \\n\\nOr perhaps we could put it a different way. What is it that we deem more worthy of our time than the Almighty One? Who is it that demands more love and affection than the God who is love? Do we dare to even attempt to give an answer? \\n\\nHowever, there is something even deeper in today’s passage. God declaring that His name “will be great among the nations” is not simply a declaration of His majesty; it is also a promise. One day, all nations will bow in reverence before the Father. The name that we now profane by serving God half heartedly — that very name will one day be held in the greatest esteem. \\n\\nHopefully today’s passage puts it all into perspective. God is in no need of our praises and affections. As Psalm 50:12 says, “If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.” \\n\\nAnd yet, Romans 5:8 says this: “But God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.” This is the scandal of grace! That the Sovereign Lord of all, to whom one day all knees will bow, would come and die for this creature from the dirt. That He, who was of no need for our love and affection, would die to show us His love and affection for us. That the Creator would die for His rebellious and blasphemous creation. \\n\\nLet us then ask ourselves once more: What is it that we deem more worthy of our devotion than our Savior? Who could we possibly love more than the One who died to show us His love? \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. To what/whom is our greatest devotion? \\n2.

This is unspeakable to do to any human, yet why does the Lord himself do such a harsh and humiliating thing? As we see in verse 3, the Lord says that this dung is nothing but the “dung of your offerings”. God was simply giving the priests a taste of what they had given Him. As we had read in Monday’s devotional, the people and the priests were giving to God a polluted sacrifice, the least of their flock. The priests ought to have humble and fearfully recognized what they have done - in offering such sacrifices, they offered dung to the Lord almighty! The Lord was merciful in his response for these priests deserve much worse, but rather than turning to repentance, they even questioned the Lord, “How have we despised your name?” (Mal. 1:6).\\n\\nWhen the Lord spreads dung on the faces of the priests, he is also removing them from his temple. This is because if an animal still had dung in its body, the dung must first be burned with fire outside of the camp (Exo. 29:14). Likewise, if the priests have dung on their faces, they simply cannot be in the presence of a Holy God and must be taken outside of His sanctuary. In verse 2, we see that they will be ineffective as priests because the Lord will curse their blessings, removing their ability to intercede for the people. Moreover, this curse will continue on to their offspring, which in the case of the tribe of Levi, are the future priests. Because there will be constant disobedience, curses will continue to overtake them, as this is nothing more than what is stated in the Law given by the Lord (Duet. 28:15). \\n\\nWhen we consider the insufficiency of the priests generation after generation, let us marvel at the sufficiency of Christ as our High Priest (Heb. 4:14-16). While the priests’ sacrifices were like dung to the Lord, Christ’s sacrifice was so pleasing to the Lord (Isa. 53:10) that it ended the sacrificial system altogether! \\n\\nIf Christ is now the one and only High Priest, then what does this passage mean for us? Originally, all of Israel was called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Exo. 19:1-6). Yet because of their sin, it was necessary to set up a priestly institution as an intermediary. But now, because of Christ’s sacrifice for his Church, we as Christians can be this “holy priesthood” as we walk with Christ as his body (1 Pet. 2:5). If we are called to be a Kingdom of priests who depend on the sacrifice of our High Priest, let us consider the relevant warnings of Malachi in verses 1-2. We would be walking in disobedience if we do not listen to the Lord and or take it to heart to give honor to His name. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, do we listen to the voice of God, given to us through Scripture? Let us not only read Scripture, but truly hear it with listening ears. Or do we fail to take it to heart to honor the Lord? Let us not fall into formalism, but rather have a heavy burden and deep passion for God to be glorified! Far be it from us to follow blemished doctrinal defections. Instead, let us remember that we must offer Him our very best and tremble at the idea of smearing the Lord with our dung.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nThe Lord we serve is faithful and holy, merciful and just. In yesterday’s devotional, we looked at how God cursed the priests and smeared dung on their faces because of the dung they had offered to God in their polluted worship (Mal 2:3). God not only rebuked them and made their blessings ineffective, but He also rebuked their offspring as well. Today, we consider how God did not merely punish for the sake of revenge, but He also held fast to His perfect promise of life and peace.\\n\\n\\nVerse 4 shows that God, through purifying the Levitical priesthood, is acting so that His “covenant with Levi may stand” (Mal 2:4). God is not indifferent, but rather he is deeply involved and seeking to renew the priesthood in honor of His covenant with the tribe of Levi. In punishing the priests, God is also giving them yet another chance to humbly repent and bring them back into properly following His covenant. \\n\\n\\nIt is not exactly clear what the covenant with Levi specifically is, but there is mention of it in several other places in Scripture (Neh. 13:29). However, we do know from verse 5 that the nature of this covenant includes a posture of awe and fear of the Lord and a blessing of life and peace. Yet because the Levites could not stick to their commitment, God did not need to fulfill his promises. \\n\\n\\nSo how can this covenant with Levi stand? Once again, we are reminded that God is faithful in all of his covenants by fulfilling them through Christ. It is already such good news that God looked at a world that abandoned Him and still chose to enter into a covenant with them. But what’s crazier is that He himself fulfilled the commitments we needed so that we could receive our covenantal promises! Christ is the “offspring” of Abraham (Gen. 22:18) who brought blessing to the whole world, the Israelite who upheld the law in obedience (Heb. 4:15), and the King from the line of David who extended the Kingdom of God to all (Rev. 17:14). \\n\\n\\nIn the same way, even though God rebukes the future generations of priests, the covenant with Levi still stands because Christ has fulfilled it. Though the priests did not listen or take it to their heart to honor His name (Mal 2:2), Christ became the perfect High Priest who lived in complete submission to God and proclaimed the truth as a faithful witness to the world. Because of this, we inherit the blessing of being in Christ, who is life and peace. \\n\\n\\nChrist brought about the truly purified and consecrated Levites in His followers, the Gospel preachers. Because of Him, we as Christians are now servants who can proclaim the truth of God! However, let us remember that this covenant is still one of fear and awe - for His sake let us faithfully walk in obedience. As we will see in tomorrow’s devotional, the lips of a priest ought to guard knowledge as a messenger of the Lord of hosts (Mal. 2:7). This is especially pertinent today, as we live in a time like the days of King Asa, where Israel was “without a teacher priest and without law” (2 Chr. 15:3). The inerrant Bible has been reduced to subjective moral teachings and sanctification has turned into mere personal development.

He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. 7 For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nThe “he” that the Lord talks about here is Levi, but more specifically, He is not just talking about the one son of Jacob but his entire generation that descended. To be even more exact, God is referring to those who were of the tribe of Levi who were the true descendent of Levi — those who were true priests. Just as the true Israel are not merely those born in flesh to the generations, but those who are the spiritual descendents of Israel (Romans 9:8), the true Levites are those who follow the promises given to the children of Levi (Deuteronomy 10:8; 33:10).\\n\\nThese true Levite priests take on very important identities.\\n\\nThey are those who have “True instruction” in their mouths, and “no wrong was found” on their lips (verse 6). Quite literally this means that those priests who are the proper ministers to the Lord are those who are to preach truth and do so in correctness. “What is truth?”, this generation may echo in the words of Pilate before Jesus (John 18:38) — but the answer stands before them in all of nature and even within their hearts (Romans 2:15) and most clearly in the person of Jesus (John 14:6). The Levites were to preach the Law, the Word of God, that clearly spoke of Jesus well before His incarnation. To verbalize the Word of God was to hear the voice of God, and to read the Word of God was to see the face of God, and to speak the Law is to taste for ourselves this revelation of truth. They must instruct this truth, but also do it with no wrong (verse 6) — all interpretation and excavation of the Torah and the Prophets must be studied with utmost adherence to the character of God.\\n\\nThey are those who walk “in peace and uprightness” setting an example of a single-minded dedication to the will of God (verse 6). The priest who is to represent the whole of Israel and orate the desires of God (verse 7) must also be righteous as God is righteous (Isaiah 5:16). Imagine a priest in his ephod who goes on to drink heavily and fornicate in disgrace as the worst of the city, the people who are in need of him at the altar would tremble at the idea that this man would be the one to appease their sins before a holy God — and they certainly would not trust this man to be the one to “guard knowledge” (verse 7). \\n\\nThey are people-reformers. They turn the sinners from iniquity so that they may be holy as God is holy (verse 6; Leviticus 19:2).\\n\\nThey are guardians (verse 7). Guardians against whom? Against themselves — from men — they hold the Word in high regard and study it and preach it so that the interpretation of it may not become tainted with the evil doctrines formulated in the heart of man. They “guard knowledge” because through knowledge — true knowledge — one can come to know God in their minds and love Him in their hearts.\\n\\nThey are messengers (verse 7). A good messenger does not speak for himself but only for he who is delivering a message from. The messenger merely takes from the mouth of his master and delivers it to the recipient who must hear it. He inputs not his own ideas and recipes for success or “good news” but merely speaks what is written.\\n\\nDo we look like a true priest? Are we speaking truth in correctness? Are we people-reformers? Are we guardians? Are we messengers? Are we the peace-making righteous?\\n\\nWe have been called to be of the “royal priesthood” (1 Peter 2:9), and therefore, our answer should be a firm yes. You see, we have a Christ who is our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14) who is of the royal priestly line of Melchizedek (Hebrews 5:6). By Him, we have also become sons of God and therefore have earned the same royal line of priesthood. We have a Father who is of the greatest royalty, and a Brother of the greatest priesthood. We can be true priests because though we fall short of our many identities to fulfill in being a faithful priest, Christ fulfilled all the identities of a priest perfectly.\\n\\nIt is as though our passage today talks of Christ. True instruction was in His mouth, and no wrong was found on His lips. He walked with God in peace and uprightness, and He turned may from iniquity. For the lips of the Priest guards knowledge, and people seek instruction from His mouth, for He is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.\\n\\nIf this is the Christ we are to imitate, we ought to imitate Him with a fiery zeal.\\n\\nWe should learn the truth and learn it correctly with the intent of instructing others truthfully and correctly. We should ponder upon the Truth, Jesus Christ, day and night as the Psalmist meditates on the Law day and night (Psalm 1:2). Through the reading of the Word of God, we see the face of Christ, and in His radiance, reflected in us, we share to the world as lights of the world.\\n\\nWe should make peace and be the most righteous in the world despite what the world deems as right and wrong. Though people laugh at us for being “old fashioned” or “archaic” or perhaps even “barbaric”, we bring peace to the world by our appeasing of the Almighty for there will be no peace in us if there is no peace with God through righteousness. We must show to the world our righteousness that was bought by our Savior’s righteousness.\\n\\nWe should turn people to Christ so that they may be able to turn from their sinful ways. We should evangelize to the unbelievers so they may see Christ, and we should plead with the brothers and sisters that they may turn from any evils they are committing against the Lord.\\n\\nWe should be guarding the Word of God with zeal so that the postmodernist fancies of this age will not contaminate the Church as much as it already has. The Church must weep and ask the Lord to help us to turn back from the falsehood we have learned so that we can once again be true guardians who will rather die first than fall victim to the sentiments of Satan that topple this generation.\\n\\nWe should be messengers who share the evangelium — those who run into cities shouting “Good News! Good News! The Emperor — the King of Kings has conquered death and the world!” not sugar coating it with worldly emotionalism, antinomianism, or legalism, but filling it with the very Word of God that has been gifted us freely in the 66 books of the Bible.\\n\\nCould we be real priests?

Why is he so thankful despite his dreary circumstance? Paul explains in v15 that it is because firstly “I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus” and secondly “your love towards all the saints”. Simply put, the saints in Ephesus bear the marks of a true Christian - someone who both genuinely believes in the Lord Jesus and genuinely loves others as a result. \\n\\nIn other words, Paul is thankful God has saved other Christians, whether he knows them directly or not. Simply the existence of other believers, whether as our friends if we are lucky, or as fellow saints around the world, should compel us to come to God in thankfulness. \\n\\nFor one, we know that it is by the grace of God that allows our brothers and sisters to have faith. But moreover, we can enjoy being part of a greater body. Even when Paul’s individual circumstances seem hopeless on the surface, the greater body is still making much progress under God’s authority. Paul doesn’t forget that the restoration of the Kingdom of God is led by Christ as He works through all the saints and not merely himself. \\n\\nThat very fact that God chose to elect and save a multitude of other saints who share the same purpose as you and should be an encouragement, especially if you can fellowship with them in person! Thus in v16, Paul ceaselessly expresses thankfulness knowing that God has provided other Christians to share in bringing Him glory and partake in embodying a community of love.\\n\\nBecause of this encouragement, Paul is compelled to love those very saints by interceding for them through prayer. What does Paul pray for them to have? In v17, Paul specifically prays that the saints in Ephesus may have a “Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him”. Paul asks that they may know God, which is intricately tied with glorifying and enjoying Him. The more we know of God, the more we are filled with awe; as Romans 11:33 proclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!”. \\n\\nThis reveals that praying to know God is not meant to be exclusively for new Christians. In fact, it is normal for a Christian’s heart to have an incomplete picture of God’s attributes. v15 clearly shows that Paul is writing to mature Christians who both have faith and are exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit. Yet Paul still prays that they may know God. Why? Because knowing God is an infinite process of continual enriching. \\n\\nFrankly, we will never know God or his attributes completely on Earth. However, our understanding of Him can deepen day by day. What pops into our mind when we imagine “riches” or which truths inspire us with hope become ever more refined and polished as we mature. As we taste new angles of the glories of God, we recognize not only that God is so awesome, but that God is vastly more awesome in ways we do not yet know but will come to know in eternity. v17 explains how this is only possible through the Holy Spirit that is commissioned by the “Father of glory”. It is this Holy Spirit, which reprograms our broken conscience through sanctification, that gives us the ability to know anything about God.\\n\\nPaul prays in v18 that the Spirit will make the “eyes of your hearts enlightened”. What do Christians mean by the heart? Or the “eyes of your heart”? The heart is who we truly are and the core from which our decisions spawn. It is the inner being that resides alongside our flesh and bones. Much like how our flesh and bones are natural, and our heart supernatural, the eyes of our heart is our perception towards spiritual realities. This is why Jesus says in Matthew 13:13 “seeing they do not see”. Just like a Pharisee, there are many things we may know in our head or see with the eyes on our face but not truly grasp in our heart or perceive with the eyes on our heart. This deeper heart understanding is only possible through the Helper given to us. \\n\\nPaul prays in v18 that God may open the “eyes of our hearts” to truly know several important spiritual truths: “the hope to which he has called you” and “the riches of his glorious inheritance”. \\n\\nThere are infinitely many great hopes in the Bible for the eyes of our hearts to be opened to. For example, to name one: 1 Peter says that our inheritance “can never perish, spoil or fade”. In fact “this inheritance is kept in heaven for you” - even your ability to have faith is shielded by God’s power! Paul is praying that truths like this would not only be known by the mind, but also penetrate the heart.  \\n\\nFurthermore, Paul prays for an understanding of “the riches of his glorious inheritance”. It ought to cause our hearts to leap with more joy than if we had just received a million dollars! Yet this is often not the case. Our imperfect hearts do not fully comprehend how much greater and more worthwhile heaven is compared to Earth. However, the more the Spirit opens the eyes of our hearts, the dimmer earthly treasures seem in comparison to heavenly things. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How often do we give thanks to God for the fellow brothers and sisters in our lives? Do we take them for granted? Do we idolize them or seek their approval above God?\\n\\n2.

Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? 11 Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. 12 May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom God’s direct words, Malachi starts speaking to his fellow men of Judah. Throughout this passage, Malachi is urging and beseeching his brethren to once again come back to the Lord.\\n\\n\\nMalachi poses two rhetorical questions: “Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?” (verse 10). These questions can be (and should be) answered simply by the audience by: “We have one Father — Yahweh. We have one Creator — Yahweh.” Assuming such responses, Malachi continues his rebuke to describe the wrongdoings of Judah and Israel. Specifically, the sons of Jacob have been “faithless” in many ways that profane the “covenant of our fathers” (verse 10). Both Judah, the chosen line of the Messiah, and Israel, the chosen people of God, have been committing sin against God in faithlessness (verse 11). Judah has been faithless as if a son usurping a father’s honor and respect, and Israel has been an abomination as if a vessel would revolt against its potter. Specifically, within our passage today, they have been (1) faithless to one another (verse 10), and (2) faithless to God (verse 11).\\n\\n\\nFirstly, God’s chosen people have been faithless in their serving of their fellow brothers and sisters. We have been called to love our neighbors by Jesus Himself (Matthew 22:39), and this is the same that Malachi is urging in verse 10. Malachi accuses the returned exiles of being faithless to one another which is an act of “profaning the covenant of our fathers” (verse 10; Leviticus 19:18). It is quite easy to be faithless to our fellow believers because it is so hard for us humans to be faithful in the first place. To be faithful, we must be loving, honest, patient, gracious, caring, and more, but to be faithless, we need only lack in one of those things. We need only get angry once for the wrong reason at our fellow brother in Christ, and we need only to ignore once the urgent request of a fellow sister to break our faith. Of course, from the text — from the exasperated tone of Malachi, we see that the breaking of faith was more than a one time occurence, but often the consequences are quite similar no matter the measure of our unfaithfulness. Because we were faithless once, we often lose friends, spouses, and even friends.\\n\\n\\nThe covenants given by God are to ensure us a better life on earth — which is partly why we follow it, however, more importantly they also reveal, in a glimpse, some truths about God’s relationship with us as well. This is why Malachi starts off with the two questions about God’s identity (verse 10). If God is our Father and our Creator, why do we not respect our fellow Israelites as brothers and sisters, and as fellow precious creations of the Great I Am? If truly, Yahweh is our Father and our Creator, why do we not stay faithful to our loved Body of Christ as equal inheritors, and as perfectly-designed vessels for God’s work?\\n\\n\\nSecondly, Judah and Israel have not been faithful to their God. The great and first commandment is to “love the Lord your God with all your soul, with all your heart, and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37-38). It is the great and first command because without it, the second commandment is impossible (Matthew 22:39), and because upon these two, all the Laws and the Prophets depend (Matthew 22:40). To profane the “sanctuary of the Lord” (verse 11) is to dishonor the worship offered to the Lord, and to marry “the daughter of a foreign god” (verse 11) is to honor a different god (that is, a false one for there is no other) in place of the true God of Judah and Israel. Particularly, Judah has married the women of other gods, which was forbidden in Exodus 34, to fall away from their fathers’ worship of Yahweh, to fall to the worship of their foreign wives.\\n\\n\\nIn our generation, there is not as much physical idolatry, and perhaps not even as multitude of foreign religions as there were in the time of Malachi, but we worship foreign gods at a far more regular rate than the Israelites. Money, sex, visual stimulation, and even studies and success have become our gods that we are willing to marry into this culture of Babylon with. You may have heard this rant a million times from various youth pastors and stressed-out pastors who cannot seem to get their congregation to turn from their evil ways, but it cannot be stressed enough. God hates — abhors, detests, is disgusted by — your gods. The false gods of empty promises that are no different from the Baal-peor for which the Israelites were executed (Numbers 25:1-9). The Israelites worshipped these gods so they can gain sexual pleasures and supposed prosperity from the locals, and how are we any different? We turn to the stimulating images of the world of the famous actors and actresses clad (or often unclad) in the idolatrous representations of the false gods of money, sex, and more. Are we making money for the services of God, or are we making money our god? Are we studying for illumination of God in our studies, or are we illuminating our studies as god?\\n\\n\\nLet us behold the curse of verse 12 and tremble: “May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!” This means that there are people who still go to church — “who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts” — who can be and will be “cut off from the tents of Jacob”. This is an echo of Jesus’s warning “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 7:21). Do you truly know the Lord and fear Him? Do you love Him because He has delivered you from such fear into His adoption? Do you want to please your Father because you have received so much that you have only to give?\\n\\n\\nO, let us all repent, for we are an idolatrous people — if we have turned, let us seek him again, for He is faithful though we are not.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

Today, we see how the returned priests from Babylon have done the opposite of what is assigned to them.\\n\\nInstead of walking with the Lord “in peace and uprightness” (verse 6), they have “turned aside from the way” (verse 8). Instead of having “True instruction” and having “turned many from iniquity” (verse 6), they have “caused many to stumble” (verse 8). Instead of keeping the covenant (verse 5), they have “corrupted the covenant of Levi” (verse 8).\\n\\nWhat is the consequence of this? God will make these priests to be “despised and abased before all the people” (verse 9). How much? He will do so “inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction.” (verse 9) — as much as they have perverted the Law with both human favoritism and selectively obeying the commandments of God, they will be punished with the equivalent abasement.\\n\\nSome people read these curses from God in the Old Testament as if it does not apply to their lives as well. They may say, “That was the Old Testament — God doesn’t curse anyone any more. He’s the God of love that loves everyone no matter what they do!”. For these people, a rude awakening awaits them if the God they believe is “the same yesterday and today and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). This is the same God who curses the Pharisees who had taken on the same rebellious attitude towards priestly duties in the New Testament. Even reading the one chapter of Matthew 23, one would get the sure sense that this God is a God who hates wickedness and curses all those who do wicked things (Psalm 11:5).\\n\\nYes, God hates covenant breaking evildoers, and this should rightly bring fear into our hearts as all men break our side of the covenant with God. Even us Christians are sinners who have worshipped God with a lacking heart, turned others away from the right way, stumbled others, and have corrupted the priestly covenant that we have with God — these verses apply as equivalently to us as it did to Malachi’s contemporary priests.\\n\\nOf course, Christ has appeased us, and have completed in perfection His priestly duties to be imputed upon us to declare us as forensically perfect in the eyes of God, but does that mean we are off the hook?\\n\\nWe must understand that this passage is talking about and to the Levite priests. They are the specially chosen ones who know the Lord. Yes, God is talking to an Israelite people who may not actually know God, but He is also talking directly to a people who ought to know God. This means that God is talking to a people who have all the necessary means to know God, and perhaps know God. We, if we are truly Christian, ought to know God more than any Levite. We have the living Word of God at our disposal at our fingertips — we just read two verses of it! God is speaking directly to those who would know God — us, the Christians.\\n\\nThe foremost audience of this passage are the Christians who have forgotten and turned away from their priestly duties. That may be us. If so, we are in danger of being “despised and abased before all the people” (verse 9). This is certainly not a threat to our salvation for that is guaranteed for us if we are truly in Christ, but it should scare us and bring us to prayer if we are mature Christians seeking to become more like our Savior.\\n\\n“Why should we fear being “despised and abased before all the people” — I do not fear man!”, one may say. And he would be right — but perhaps a little too impulsive in his answer. A mature Christian fears not the despising and the abasing of the self if it is for the gain of Christ (Acts 5:41). However, he also considers it loss and shame if their suffering and abasement came as a result of their evil works (1 Peter 4:15). We fear being “despised and abased” because of our fear for the glory of God to be hidden in the eyes of men because of our shameful acts. We fear that we have repaid the love of God with hatred.\\n\\nGod is our Father and He has shown us great love. What kind of a good son would spit on the face of a Father who adopted us into His great inheritance? If we had been put on a robe and a ring and a pair of sandals (Luke 15:22) that shows us to be sons and daughters of the living God, would we not act the part and desire to please our Father who has given so much to us? Would we not want to at the very least not shame the very God who loved us so much?\\n\\nIn our case in the passage, we see that this would be a shameful instance of being “despised and abased before all the people” (verse 9). Our evil ways would be revealed and the people would laugh at the so-called “priests” who are but playing grown up with linen ephods that do not fit our still milk-drinking bodies (Hebrews 5:12).\\n\\nWhat shall we do then? We should pray the prayer of Moses on Mount Sinai in Exodus 32:12:\\n“Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and relent from this disaster against your people.”\\nWe should beg the Lord, for your sake, for your sake, forgive us to realize our mistakes to turn back to proper worship!\\n\\nHave we erred in any way in our worship to turn away from the Lord and to “turn aside from the way”, to have “caused many to stumble”, or “corrupted the covenant of Levi”? If so, let us repent and return to Him, for we have a forgiving God (Joel 2:12).\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Let us ask for clear eyes that allow us to see if we have turned from the covenant given us in Christ that leads us to a royal priesthood.\\n2. Have we cared for our Father in heaven in our actions?

And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. 16 “For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the Lord, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless.”\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nThe third disputation in Malachi focuses on Judah’s profanation of the covenant of marriage, and we see that here in today’s passage. \\n\\n\\nMalachi reminds Judah of a very important truth that we must all understand: marriage is a covenant made before God. These words have become so commonplace, and yet many of us do not know what this actually means. In verse 14, it says that God is a “witness” in marriage, and verse 15 says that God gives a “portion of His Spirit” in this union. This means that God has an active part in marriage. He is the one that joins man and woman together - not the man, not the woman, not anybody or anything else. \\n\\n\\nTherefore, the people of Judah not honoring the covenant of marriage pointed to a deeper issue: that they did not fear the Lord. They had a complete disregard for what God had joined together and the covenant that He had made and only focused on satisfying their own selfish desires. What an arrogant and shameless deed it is to ignore the union that is filled with God’s own Spirit!\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, for those of us that are dating or have any desire to date in the future, let us continually ask ourselves this question: does our relationship reflect a fear of the Lord? Or do we simply try to “cover all the bases” so that we can safely label our relationships as “Christian,” without giving second thought to what is pleasing in God’s eyes? \\n\\n\\nAnd before we fabricate a million different things that we think God seeks in such relationships, verse 15 gives us a clear answer: “Godly offspring.” There is no room for our own views of what we think marriage should be because it is an institution designed by God. Marriage is to be between a man and woman, and God intends it to produce Godly offspring and grow His kingdom.  \\n\\n\\nWe must understand that marriage, and by some extension dating, is not whatever we want it to be. It is a foolish thing to fantasize about marriage as a fairy tale story where we find the perfect person and live happily ever after because it can take our eyes off of what God intends for the marriage that He formed. Instead, it fixes our gaze on what we want marriage to be, leaving us just like the Israelites who had no regard for God. \\n\\n\\nBut the biggest reason that the covenant of marriage must be honored is because of what it represents. The reason that God is displeased with divorce and faithlessness is because it ruins the picture of marriage. Marriage must show God’s faithfulness and reflect Jesus’s covenant bond with His Church. \\n\\n\\nLet us think for a second how terrible it would be if Jesus’s covenant with His Church was as flimsy as what we have made marriage to be through divorce and faithlessness. What if Jesus left the covenant because He simply wasn’t satisfied anymore or because He felt like He was simply drifting apart from the Church? Praise God that this is not so! \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, marriage is not something that we can do with as we please. All things, including marriage, must point to God’s glory and His everlasting faithfulness and goodness. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What do we think of when we think of marriage? Do we think of God at all? \\n2. What areas of our life do we have yet to surrender to God?

They were discouraged and confused because they had heard from the prophets Haggai and Zechariah that the Lord would restore their land to greatness (Haggai 2, Zechariah 2), but they were still just a nation that was barely recovering from exile. They were told that the Lord would once again inhabit Jerusalem and its temple, but they had yet to see God’s presence in their temple. Essentially the people of Israel were asking the question: if there is a good God, then why don’t I see His goodness? Or put a different way, the Israelites were charging God directly: God if you are a good God like you say, then prove it! \\n\\nWhat an arrogant, foolish, conceited thing to say! This is the holy God that killed 24,000 Israelites for their sexual immorality in Numbers 25. This is the God who is so holy that Moses, a friend of God, would have died if he saw the Lord. This is the Holy One that made Isaiah scream in dread and terror when he saw the Lord because he realized his own sinfulness. \\n\\nTherefore, to charge God with not only being unholy, but also delighting in evil is a baseless charge against the character of God. The Israelites were failing to remember who God was and what He had done. Do we not also do this? Do we not question God’s goodness when it is difficult to see Him, just as the Israelites are doing here? When we feel as though God has forgotten about us, do we make a charge on God’s character? Perhaps we doubt his goodness, or perhaps we doubt his perfect love for us. Brothers and sisters, let us be careful with our words, lest we sin against God. Let us remember who God is, that He is a good and holy God. \\n\\nBut Judah’s blasphemy does not end at simply charging God’s holiness. They go on to ask for a “God of justice.” Somehow, the Israelites were so blind to their own sin, their own dead offerings and faithless marriages, that they demanded justice be served. Let us be clear: if justice were delivered at the exact moment the Israelites asked “where is the God of justice,” they would have all been damned in an instant. \\n\\nWe know that we cannot scoff at these Israelites because we do the same thing. We are so quick to complain before God and question His goodness before seeing the sin rooted within us that prevents us from truly coming before the Lord. Even Job, the man who we all know as the one that faithfully withstood great trials, sinned in this way by affirming his own blamelessness before that of God’s (Job 33:8-12). \\n\\nBut perhaps the greatest folly in today’s passage is that the Israelites didn’t understand the greatness and beauty of what God had promised them. They were so shortsighted that they did not rejoice in the promise of God’s coming covenant, where He would write His “law on their hearts” (Jeremiah 31:33). They had no regard for the fact that the holy God had not only returned them from exile after their countless and unending sins, but had also promised a coming glory to the land (Zechariah 8). Instead, they had the audacity to demand that God show his goodness when He had shown them nothing but goodness, mercy, and love. \\n\\nAgain, are we not guilty of the same thing? Do we not fail even this morning to remember what Jesus has done for us and the great promise that we have in Him? Do we not forget that one day, the Great King who rules all the cosmos will personally wipe each tear from our eyes (Revelation 21:4)? Do we not forget what mercy and love God has lavished upon us by adopting us (1 John 3:1)? Do we not ignore the Spirit that we have been given to help guide and counsel us? And do we instead focus only on the issues at hand, forgetting the promises that are made to us and who it is that made these promises? \\n\\nFar be it from us, brothers and sisters. Far be it from us. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Is there any part of us that questions God or holds any bitterness towards Him? Let us reflect carefully and ask God to help us trust in who He is. \\n2. Let us take time this morning to remember who God is and what He has done for us.

And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nWe see in Malachi 2 verse 17 that the people weary the Lord with yet another set of insulting questions. They ask the Lord why He delights in evil and where his Justice is. What a foolish thing for them to ask! Not only have the people of Judah despised the Lord through their idolatry, polluted worship, and faithless marriages, but they also speak without any recognition of the condemnation they rightfully deserve in their wickedness. It is enough already that God in his mercy did not destroy them, but now the people themselves are asking for the God of Justice. They are essentially asking Him to withhold the very mercy that is keeping them alive - asking for judgement means asking to be judged!\\n\\n\\nYet despite such an ignorant and insulting question, the Lord yet again responds with mercy. This time, he promises a “messenger, and he will prepare the way before me”. The Lord is reminding Judah of all the promises and prophecies about the coming Messiah and the messenger who would herald His coming. \\n\\n\\nWho is this messenger? This question is later revealed in Malachi 4:5 when the Lord says that he will send “Elijah the prophet”. Elijah was a Tishbite man appointed by God to be his messenger and to make bold declarations to a hostile King and an idolatrous people. He was a man of the wilderness hated by many, yet God gave him faith and a prayerful spirit to perform miracles before the people that would turn them to repentance (1 Kings 17-19). His faith to challenge the prophets of Baal and Asherah led many Israelites to fall on their faces and say, “The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God” (1 Kings 18:39).\\n\\n\\nThis messenger as we know is fulfilled in John the Baptist, who came in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). John the Baptist along with proclaiming the arrival of Christ likewise preached a message of repentance and confronted evil rulers and pharisees. Jesus later proclaims that John is the last prophet of the Old Covenant because He himself, being God, is ultimately the Prophet to come (Matt. 11:13). John is merely a voice, quickly appearing and then disappearing; as Elijah, he symbolizes how the message of all prophets of the past point to Christ and prepare for His work of salvation. Just like how Christ came before John, so Christ was before all the prophets and everything that existed (John. 1:15). \\n\\n\\nWhat this means is that all of the Old Covenant prophets and every second of Old Covenant history was meant to prepare for Christ. To the people of Judah, it appeared that God was distant and slow to answer their cries, yet in reality, through it all, God was not only patiently withholding his wrath but also faithfully carrying out his plan for restoration. There was not and will never be a moment in which God does not act in His perfect character. Do we recognize this, or do the prayers we offer parallel the cries of Judah, carrying the same insulting stench of ignorance?\\n\\n\\nNow, if John the Baptist is the “messenger” from the verse half of verse 1, one might think that he is also the messenger in the second half of verse 1. Yet we see that this “messenger of the covenant” must be someone different. This second messenger is the one “whom you seek”, meaning he refers to the long awaited Messiah! But going back to the first half of verse 1, what’s even greater is the fact that it says the first messenger will prepare a way before me. Here, God is saying John, in the spirit of Elijah, prepares for me to come. Right after, He then says “the Lord whom you seek” will come. Since in this one verse God refers to this Messiah in both first and third person, we now know this means he is sending his Son, but imagine how confusing this verse must have seemed to those reading it before Christ. \\n\\n\\nIt is truly such a privilege that in Christ, we have clarity and fulfillment in everything about the laws and prophets. In the second half of verse 1, Malachi prophesied, Christ will “suddenly come to his temple”. Because of Christ, who tore the veil, when we are saved, he suddenly comes into the temple of the New Covenant, which is our hearts because we are now in Him (Jer. 31:33). Truly, through Christ our Lord, we now have a Covenant that gives us life and a messenger in whom we delight (verse 1)!\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, this is the God we serve: He looks upon the insults of people far below his infinite holiness with patience and responds with a promise of scandalous grace! Let us recognize who we are and who He is! \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What are some ways in which you, like the people of Judah, question the faithfulness of God? Does it match up with the character of God we see in Scripture? How does it affect the attitude of your prayers? What are some truths that we can remind ourselves of?"},"name":"day54"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"Malachi 3:2-5: Messiah the Refiner\\n\\nMay 16, 2020\\n\\n\\n2 But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner\'s fire and like fullers\' soap. 3 He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the Lord. 4 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years.\\n\\n5 “Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nYesterday, we saw what Malachi said in response to Judah, who asked the insulting question of “Where is the God of justice?”. The Lord reminded His rebellious people that he will send a messenger to prepare a way for Himself to come down as their Messiah. However, Malachi immediately turns back to the people and in verse 2 asks: “who can endure the day of his coming?”. In their foolish self-righteousness, the people had assumed that judgement would only affect the wicked surrounding Pagan nations. But the answer to this question is nobody! The people asked the question in an attitude of complaint, but they should have asked in fear and trembling, for “who can stand when he appears”?\\n\\n\\nIt would have been disastrous for the people if God’s judgement came down that day! For nothing unclean will ever enter heaven, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false (Rev. 21:27). If even Moses was told that he could not see the Lord’s face and live (Exo. 33:20), how much worse is fate of the corrupted Levites and all of Judah! God makes it clear where this judgement is aimed in verse 5, saying “I will draw near to you for judgement”. \\n\\n\\nYet in light of this frightening question, Malachi describes in verse 3 how after the Lord comes, the sons of Levi “will bring offerings in righteousness to the Lord”. How is this possible? There seems to be a discrepancy between how the people will be judged. On one hand, verse 2 says the Lord would be “a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap”, one who removes impurities so that sinners can shine like pure, precious metal. Yet on the other hand, verse 5 says that the Lord would be a “swift witness against” sinners and later says that he shall set them ablaze so that it will leave them neither root nor branch (Mal. 4:1). \\n\\n\\nIs God’s fire refining or all-consuming? Paul makes it clear in Romans 2:11 that God shows no partiality - it is not His fire that invariably blazes stronger from person to person, but rather it is the identity of the person that determines how he will stand. Not everyone is gold or silver! For it is those without Christ, who are nothing but sin, who will be utterly consumed by fiery judgement. Yet the fate of those in Christ is different. These are us Christians, who by God’s grace have died to self and have been raised with Christ to become like precious metal in Him. Though sin is still present in our lives, through sanctification, God’s refining fire will wipe away our sin in an all-consuming manner, leaving us without blemish so that we can be reunited with him! The very reason why we stand justified is because we were given a regenerated heart and have turned into precious metal. Our offerings are no longer an abomination to the Lord but are rather “offerings in righteousness” because they are offered along with Christ’s perfect sacrifice, the singular “offering” which will always be “pleasing to the Lord” (verse 4). \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us remember that our Messiah is our refiner. Let us count this as joy, for if we are not refined then we have no place in heaven. We often hear about the process of purifying precious metal, but Malachi also says that God will be like fullers\' soap. Fullers were people who removed impurities from wool. This process involved washing the wool with fullers’ soap, beating it against the rock, and stretching it to increase its strength. Make no mistake, the process of sanctification is thorough and severe and we ought not to take it lightly. But yet in this we rejoice, for the tested genuineness of our faith will result in the praise and glory and honor of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 1:6-7). For if we truly were without discipline then we are illegitimate children rather than sons of God (Heb. 12:8). Let us once again praise God - for in Christ, we have become the sheep separated from the goats (Mat. 25:33), like wool, waiting to be purified. \\n\\n\\nLet us make haste to put off our old self and put on our new self. If our hearts are made new in Christ, we have no desire for the sin that once consumed us. Carefully examine the ways of the wicked in verse 5. Are we like sorcerers and adulterers, tainted by the culture of the Babylon of today? Or do we swear falsely, ashamed to speak the truth which is Christ? Or do we have a heart for the lamenting widows and fatherless orphans around us, who do not yet know their Bridegroom and Father in heaven? By the Holy Spirit, let us be engaged in constant sanctification.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us look to Christ, our Messiah and refiner. For soon we as precious metal shall be fully refined so that when he looks upon us, His image will be radiantly reflected back!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What is our attitude towards the momentary affliction of Christian life? Do we see the good in it and endure with steadfastness? Consider the words of Charles Simeon: \\n\\n“My dear brother, we must not mind a little suffering for Christ’s sake. When I am getting through a hedge, if my head and shoulders are safely through, I can bear the pricking of my legs.

Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ \\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n“For I the Lord do not change” (verse 6) should be the most fearful thing any human being could hear. For as we read in the five verses that came before this passage, the coming of the Lord will be “like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap” (verse 2). A refiner’s fire burns to dust any impurities and puts the ores into a trial of bearing the precious metals that live within. If the ore is naught but the impurities, it is burned up in the fire and the ashes tossed away. The fullers’ soap takes away the grime left on clothing to reveal the true nature of the clothing within. If the garment is beautiful and worthy, it will survive the hands of the fuller; if it is clothing rotten to every thread, it will fall apart in the scourging soap.\\n\\nThe Lord is immutable, and hence, He is the same God in the New Testament as He is in the Old Testament. He is the God whose hatred of sin destroyed the Egyptians, put to execution the idol worshippers (Exodus 32:25-29; Numbers 25:1-9), and even put Israel and Judah into exile (2 Kings 25:1-21). This means that He did not stand for sin yesterday, and He will not stand for sin today.\\n\\nYet, interestingly, we are given the second part of the verse 6, “therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed” (verse 6b). This should make us pause. We had just read about a mighty fire hot enough to burn off stone and melt metal — yet, the sinful Jacob is not consumed? How can this be?\\n\\nFortunately for those who are in covenant with the Lord, for those who are loved for some unconditional reason, the fire will refine, rather than destroy. Yes, the fire will hurt, it will reveal what ugliness made up our disposition, but it will refine to bring out the beauty that has been regenerated within the hearts of the elect.\\n\\nGod does not change, and therefore, He will not change His mind to forget His promises to Adam (Genesis 3:15), to Abraham for (Genesis 12:1-3; 13:14-18; Genesis 15), His promises to David (2 Samuel 7:12-16), and more.\\n\\nFor us, the redeemed Bride of Christ, He will not forget His fulfillment of the covenant of works, and establishment of the New Covenant on that cross.\\n\\nYou see, those who have the covenant of Christ between themselves and God, those who have been regenerated, have within them the shining work of Christ that is more precious than any precious ore. In them is the righteousness that shines like clear glass (Revelation 21:21) that cannot be tarnished by the impurities that surround it. Unlike those outside of the covenant, those who are without God, whose wickedness makes up their whole being — with no precious metal to be found, the declared righteous (through the work of the cross) will enjoy the glorification through the removal of all their sin — the burning off of the dross.\\n\\nThough Judah, at the time of Malachi, and us, in the new covenant, have “turned aside from my[God’s] statutes and have not kept them”, God, in His mercy and steadfast love, invites us yet again to Him, “Return to me, and I will return to you” (verse 7). For those who are in Christ, we can fall away, but God will never let us go. He looks on at us and speaks — “return to me”. This is the invitation of our Father to His joy. If we are His sons and daughters, how can we turn away from His welcoming arms?\\n\\nTo this good news, how will you respond?\\n\\nEven with the vast riches of God’s Law revealed to them, the Israelites replied, “How shall we return?” (verse 7) as if they had never heard God’s words before. They were the chosen nation with the beauty of the Law to meditate on in every synagogue and the temple in Israel, yet they answer, “How shall we return?”. What a rebellious retort to the God of humility who chooses to speak to His own creation’s misguidance and fallacious ways? This is the chosen Judah! The supposedly great line of kings!\\n\\nYet, before we make any further judgment upon this nation of covenants, let us look to ourselves who have the fullness of the Law that reveals the very Word, Jesus. We have the full sixty-six books of divine revelation that make us to feel as if we are staring into the face of Christ Himself. Yet, have we not turned away from God in so many ways as well? If we have been given a greater revelation than ever before — one that would have made the prophets to widen their eyes in disbelief and kings to give up their riches for a piece of, should we not live more richly in the preciousness of God’s decretive promises?\\n\\nEven now, the echoes of God’s Fatherly pleading can be heard for His chosen people of all nations upon the cries of the Messiah on the cross. “Return to me” He says, and if we hear His calling, shall we ignore the love of the shepherd? Let us be holy, brothers and sisters. Let us hear the Words of God speaking to us daily as we peer into scripture.\\n\\nLest we become like the Israelites in forgetting the love of God, let us love His word evermore to know and learn and relearn of the God who does not change.\\n\\n“Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and faithfulness!” — Psalm 115:1\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

To steal from an official of perhaps the most powerful government in all the world would be a suicide mission at worst and an imprisonment at best.\\n\\n\\nThe Israelites had been commanded quite clearly in the Law about the need to offer up to the Lord the tenth of their firstfruits (Genesis 14:20; Leviticus 27:30-33; Deuteronomy 14:22-29). This tithe would be a declaration of the Israelites of their knowledge and belief that God was the one who provided all things to them. It would be the act of giving back the portion of what was already owed to God, and God gifting the rest of the nine portions to the Israelites. Tithing was not an act of offering to a needy God, but the dedication of the treasures of our hearts to the only God.\\n\\n\\nThis tithe would be used by the Levites who had no inheritance of their own, and would be used to provide for the needs of the tabernacle (and the temple) and the needs of those who were taking care of the temple. It was not that the Lord would consume the tithe, but He would actually give it to Israel’s ministers for Israel’s own good.\\n\\n\\nYet, here, we see that the Israelites had abandoned the tithe (verses 8-9). Though no sane individual would rob the United States government, the Israelites were willing to rob God and His officials.\\n\\n\\nTo this disgraceful act of ignominy to God’s name, God subjects Himself to a test. This is a ridiculous idea — a man may be put to the test for he is an ignoble, wicked human being who cannot be trusted, but God? The Holy God who is perfectly righteous (Isaiah 8:13)? The immutable God who is perfectly truthful (Numbers 23:19)? Even Ahaz, an evil king of Israel dared not to test the Lord (Isaiah 7:12). You shall never put the Lord to the test as it is an implicit assertion that there can be such a thing as the degradation of God’s perfection (Deuteronomy 6:16), yet God puts Himself to the test out of His exasperated love for Israel.\\n\\n\\nIn verses 10-12, the depths of God’s Fatherly love is revealed. He desires to bring Israel to fruitfulness. He would love to see Israel to be blessed with all that they need. Yet, He withholds it as a Father would to His children who need much rebuke and reconsideration of their ways. Sometimes, our struggles and suffering are the results of our righteousness in a broken world. Sometimes, our pains are for God to strengthen us. Sometimes, as is this case, God admonishes us with the strikes of a loving parent in order for us to turn back from our evil ways so as to fix our eyes upon what is true.\\n\\n\\nGod desired for Israel to stop their robbing, and for them to once again give to God the honor that was owed to Him. If so, God would provide all they could ever need as all is God’s and those who are His children have all that is God’s to give to us (Luke 15:31).\\n\\n\\nIf God is our Father, He is not the failing, weak human that we often are disappointed by. He is the God who opens “the windows of heaven for you and pour[s] down for you a blessing until there is no more need”  (verse 10). He is the God who controls all things — He “rebuke[s] the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear” (verse 11). He is a God who is in authority of all things — including your blessings, and He gives good things to us, so that the other nations will look to us and call us blessed (verse 12). As the nations look to the Church and call it blessed, Christ, the head of the Church, is glorified.\\n\\n\\nHowever, I do want to make one thing clear. God does not always give us good things. Even when we are seemingly righteous, God seems to hide His face — why? I mentioned it for a short second above, but it is to strengthen us. He is a good Father, and as a good father does, He will sanctify us through suffering (as He did so often with David and Paul) to make us to be ever more reliant on Him and to find all joy in Him.\\n\\n\\nThis is pertinent to the idea of the Christian family — the family of God. If our God merely was a machine we feed obedience into to receive blessings, we could not call Him Father. Yet, because He is our Father, in times, we are given things according to our obedience, and in other times, we are stricken with the realities of this fallen world so as to make us to be ever more recognizant of His grace. In either situation, we seek the Father who is enough for us. In the times of good, we see that all good things are from the Father, in times of disobedience, we see our fallen nature, and in times of questionable suffering, we see the hope of our received salvation.\\n\\n\\nWe see, in God’s forgiving desire to restore the blessings of Israel, that He truly loves to bless a people who do not deserve to be blessed. If so, we must look not to the mountainous task at hand, but to the one, same God who is both offering the covenant and fulfilling the covenant through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. When we see the Law given to us, do we see the broken heart of the Father? Or do we see but a laundry list of to-dos?\\n\\n\\nGod is wanting His children to enjoy Him. Yet, we are often too blind to learn from His careful, and patient chastisement. Let us look once again to the extent of His love displayed for the elect that they may know Him.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n1.

Evildoers not only prosper but they put God to the test and they escape.’”\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nWe live in an age when even one misplaced word or a mistaken formulation of a sentence could heap mounds of prejudice against you, and a complete social deprecation of your character. More so than ever before, people are sensitive to the even least consequential utterances of words, and are recognizant of the dangers of the tongue.\\n\\n\\nYet, it also seems that this is the generation that most breaks the third commandment given to Moses on Mount Sinai. “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7) says the Lord, but an individual, even a Christian, often would ponder more about their choice of words to their friend, than about their thoughts and words to the God of the universe.\\n\\n\\nIt is to a generation such as this that the Lord of hosts speaks with all might and force — yet in a way so pleading and heart-breaking only as a Father could speak.\\n\\n\\nSo what words of the Israelites have been so “hard” against the Lord (verse 13)? What kind of words could be so hurtful to God? It is that the Israelites bear a testimony of God that is not true of Him. They say “It is vain to serve God” because they do not see profit from serving the God of promises (verse 14). They instead “call the arrogant blessed” because they seem to prosper (verse 15). Such words are untrue and outright evil because of two reasons.\\n\\n\\nFirstly, they do not recognize their own actions that contributed to the consequences they now are consumed by. Majority of the text before this passage testify to the evils of the exiles of Israel that explicitly disregarded the Law. They will look not to the evils that they have committed but look to the world and its fallenness to see enticing of a fruit to eat of. They see the evildoers do well and think it wise to follow and therefore lay fallow in the fate of those who do evil. What foolishness that they would not consider the rebuke of the Lord to find in it a short suffering that leads to an eternal bliss?\\n\\n\\nThey do not recognize that they have not done good, but have done evil. And hence, they acknowledge not that the hardship they face is the rod of the Lord that is brought down in love. God is a God who is a proper parent to His children (Proverbs 13:24), and therefore will not hesitate to bring the rod if the need arises.\\n\\n\\nBy saying that God is blessing the evildoers (verse 15), they are not only blaspheming the justice and righteousness of God, but are not recognizing themselves to be sinners.\\n\\n\\nSecondly, it is quite obvious that the Israelites do not desire God, but the things from God. Their words are hard because they speak of serving God as something to profit from and to prosper from. If we truly think God to be a being with whom we can have a relationship with, it would be horrifying to think of God as merely a vending machine or an ATM where we follow the instructions offered by the machine to receive certain goods we want in return. Yet, this is the way the Israelites thought of God. Instead of doing sanctifying works because they loved God, they kept His charge for profit (verse 14). When it did not pay off, they decided the ATM was dysfunctional and moved on to a different ATM. This ATM turned out to be the worldly way of thinking — to call the “arrogant blessed”, and to follow in the path of “Evildoers” who “prosper” even though “they put God to the test and they escape” (verse 15).\\n\\n\\nIf anyone goes to their friend and says, “I can’t hang out with you anymore. I’m just not getting the kind of value I need from our relationship.”, we know that the individual never had love for the friend to begin with. If anyone goes to their spouse and says, “I just don’t think you’re the right parent for me. It’s time for me to move on.”, we may deduce that this person does not understand the Biblical concept of covenantal love, hesed, in Hebrew.\\n\\n\\nThe Israelites were doing this very same thing to God. They had served God, not for Himself, but for what He gave to them. Those are perhaps the hardest words anyone could hear.\\n\\n\\nI admit, we live in a post-truth world where love has become defined on the shaking sands of the human heart, but we, the Church, must stand solid on the Rock that is Christ. We have truths about love that we cannot uproot ourselves from, and we have a foundation so immutable that we cannot escape it except to fall to our deaths. Though the world makes the self deity, could we look to God for our source of all foundational truths? And if so, could we look to God as more than the fulfiller of our desires, but rather the very object of desire itself? For that is the love that was shown us on that rugged cross.\\n\\n\\nOur words are often the first outward emergence of our inward knowledge and desire of God.

Paul wants the “eyes of our hearts” to be enlightened about several truths - these are truths that we may know in our minds but have not understood in our hearts. \\n\\nThe final truth Paul mentions in v19 is the “power towards us who believe”. \\n\\nOur hearts tend to cheapen or outright ignore the magnitude of this power. It’s already hard enough for us to recognize God’s power towards nature, like when He commands the Red Sea to part. If we tremble at the demolishing power of a tsunami wave, then how much greater is the power of our God who can instantly rupture the entire sea of which these waves are but a ripple? \\n\\nYet what Paul says in v19 is even more mind-boggling than this. That God’s power, beyond anything we can imagine, is not only towards nature, but also towards us! Do you recognize the sheer amount of power that was needed to conquer your sin-infested, prideful, perverted souls from death to life? Frankly, the answer to this question is no! While it is barely possible to fathom the power of splitting the sea, it is in fact impossible for us to fathom the glory of the resurrection power of the Godhead. Paul says the greatness of this power is immeasurable! \\n\\nEven so, through v20-23, Paul attempts to describe just how glorious this resurrection power is. Immediately, we recognize in v20 that this power is linked to the resurrection. To paraphrase, this great power is according to the might of when God raised Christ from the dead. But far more than just escaping death, Christ ascended to preeminence over all life. Paul makes this clear by writing that Christ is seated at His “right hand”. To be at one’s right hand means to wield equal authority. \\n\\nLet’s not forget that this power also is towards us. God also raised us with Christ and seated us with Christ as his bride. We have experienced an immeasurably great working of God’s power to be there. Exactly what power was needed for us to be raised with Christ?\\n\\nWe see this expanded upon in v21: Christ is “above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come \'\'. This means that Christ, after his death from which he said “it is finished”, overcame and conquered any and every authority between death and the preeminent authority of God. \\n\\nThe aggregate amount of sinful powers, from apparent evils such as the ruthless authorities and kings and emperors from all of history to the invisible demonic forces that plague us in every corner of our lives - all of this accumulates to something frightening. These were precisely the forces that we once powerlessly worshiped. \\n\\nThe more we understand the power of sin that once ruled over us, the more our hearts can be enlightened about the extent of the power of God towards us as he saved us, raised us, and seated us with Christ far above these things. But more than just the power that God once gave towards us through salvation, this power is still given to us now. As sin is still present in our world, and as our sinful hearts cannot fully fathom the truths of the Word, this power is what also presently opens our eyes to knowing God as we are sanctified day by day. \\n\\nv22-23 shows that it is by this power that we as the church can become the “fullness of him who fills all in all”. That is to say, Christ will fill all things with His glory, which will be brought forth in fullness through us! This can only be done by His immeasurably great power towards us and should fill us with excitement.\\n\\nIt is this understanding of God’s power that Paul wishes for the “eyes of the hearts” of the Christians in Ephesus to glean. Let’s not forget that these verses were part of Paul’s prayer for Christians. So let’s imitate Paul in praying for ourselves and others that God may provide us with a “spirit of wisdom and revelation” of the nature of His power, the meaning of His power, and the glorious greatness of His power - that He may let our head-knowledge of His power seep into our hearts.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How often do you pray for God to reveal to you just how corrupting, widespread and powerful sin is? How often do you pray for God to reveal to you just how gloriously powerful He is? Is this reality gripping the “eyes of your hearts” or is it dull and overlooked by you? \\n\\n2. Meditate on God’s power towards you over the past week, month, and year. If nothing comes up, commit to this important prayer with listening ears so that you may be encouraged by this illuminating and essential truth.

The Lord paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the Lord and esteemed his name. 17 “They shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts, in the day when I make up my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. 18 Then once more you shall see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nThus far in our study of Malachi, we have seen the faithlessness and shamelessness of the Israelites. They gave half-hearted offerings while living in sin, they were unfaithful in their covenant marriages, and they even questioned God and His character. And we have seen that as a result, God had turned His face away from their offerings and their weeping because it was tainted by their sin. \\n\\n\\nBut what about the righteous? What became of the remnant that feared the Lord? In today’s passage, God Himself encourages all of us to continue to “fight the good fight” (1 Timothy 6:12) and promises that serving Him is not vain, as the Israelites thought (verse 14). In fact, it is just the opposite — it is exceedingly worth it. \\n\\n\\nIn verse 16, we immediately see that the omnipotent God of the universe pays attention to those that fear Him. It can be easy for us to get discouraged just as the Israelites did when we see the troubles in our lives and those around us. We may think that God does not truly care, or that our troubles are not significant enough for God to notice. But take heart, brothers and sisters, for God not only pays attention to those that fear Him, but He also hears and remembers (verse 16). \\n\\n\\nGod sees when you choose to dedicate time to Him in prayer daily. He sees when you treat worship services online with reverence, even if nobody will know if you simply roll out of bed a few minutes beforehand. The Almighty One notices when you suffer for His namesake, when you endure trial and hardship faithfully. And we see today that He not only notices, but He hears and remembers. \\n\\n\\nWhat becomes of those that He remembers? God promises that they will be His (verse 17), and that they shall be His “treasured possession,” just as a son is to his father. He promises that they will be spared from His judgement against the wicked, and their distinction will be clear (verse 18). What could be greater than this: that the Beautiful and Perfect One would call this creature from the dirt His treasured possession and declare it to be His own? \\n\\n\\nSo we say again, brothers and sisters, do not lose heart! For our God does not forget as we do, and He sees all things. He is surely coming to judge the living and the dead, and to give to each person what they are due. So when we begin to doubt God’s timing or His presence, let us remind ourselves of this truth. \\n\\n\\nFor those that are a part of this faithful remnant through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we have this great hope. Therefore, let us all confess once again this morning that serving the Father is overwhelmingly worth it. \\n\\n\\n“Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.” \\n\\n(James 1:12)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

The insolence and blasphemy of the Israelites is ushered out of the spotlight, and a glorious prophecy that pronounces hope for the righteous and judgement for the wicked is ushered in. \\n\\nToday’s verse has a very similar message: that the wicked shall no longer prosper and be arrogant, and they will instead be met with judgement on the day of the Lord. In recent times, the day of judgement has almost become a taboo topic in churches, with some avoiding the subject altogether. And on an individual level, some of us might not particularly care for the coming day of the Lord. However, this is the day that we are to look forward to the most —  the day where the Son returns in glory and the score is settled once and for all between the righteous and the wicked. \\n\\nUntil now, the Israelites had complained about how the wicked prospered (Chapter 3, verse 15), leading many to question whether living righteously was worth it or not. But in today’s passage, God declares that judgement is indeed coming, encouraging the Israelites and all of us reading this morning to hold fast to what is good and true. \\n\\nGod describes the day of the Lord as “burning like an oven” and a day that shall “set them ablaze” (verse 1). And when the wicked and unrighteous are met with this consuming fire, they “will be stubble” and will have “neither root nor branch.” What this means is that not a single wicked person can or will withstand God’s great judgement. Instead, they will be reduced down to nothing, along with everything else on this earth that they treasured so foolishly. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us not think for a second that storing up earthly possessions for ourselves or chasing after the things that everyone else seems to pursue has any eternal value. The relationships, the careers, the internships that we look at so longingly now will one day join the wicked as being reduced to nothing more than stubble. But our service to the Lord and our work for the Kingdom will surely remain. \\n\\nTherefore, let us realign our focus this morning, brothers and sisters. Especially in this finals season, let us not work simply for the sake of our GPA’s or our future careers or for a sense of self worth.

Many of us, with weary eyes longing towards summer clicked “submit” for the final time while sinking into a feeling of relaxation. Moments like these are great, and they remind us of the perfect peace we received the instant Christ removed the burden of our sin at Calvary. But brothers and sisters, when our eyes were fixed upon summer, were they even more so fixed upon Christ, our hope of glory? Is He truly the one whom we longed for the most? \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now that we are finally finished, how has our carefree summer mindset affected our spiritual disciplines? Make no mistake, we should all enjoy a well-deserved break, but let us rest in Christ so that momentary comforts do not rob us of the joy we find in Him alone. Rejuvenate your slumberous mornings by preaching to your hearts the moment that you wake! In our newfound free time, let us intensify our communion with God in prayer and sink deeper into the splendor of Scripture.\\n\\n\\nChristian, what does the name of the LORD mean to you? We so easily forget that His name is so great that it inspires our fear. Verse 2 of today’s passage is addressing “you who fear my name”. When we think about the name of our LORD, we are reminded of the time it was gloriously proclaimed before Moses as he hid in the cleft of a rock. “Yahweh! Yahweh! A God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty” (Exo. 34:6). Immediately, Moses fell before the Lord, quickly bowing his head in worship! Here, upon witnessing Yahweh proclaimed at Sinai, Moses experienced a theophany, a manifestation of God. \\n\\n\\nThis theophany however was only a foreshadowing of the climactic theophany of Christ. When Christ proclaimed the name of Yahweh upon the cross, He proclaimed His Holiness, Righteousness, Love, Justice, Wrath, and all His other attributes in a way that far exceeded what Moses had witnessed. When Hebrews calls the Son the “radiance of the glory of God” (Heb. 1:3), do we comprehend the magnitude of this radiance? This is important to recognize when we read these verses from the final chapter of Malachi. Here, Malachi is addressing “you who fear my name” because they are those who understand that one cannot look at the sun without being blinded. To these people, Malachi proclaims Christ, “the sun of righteousness” (Mal. 4:2). \\n\\n\\nWho is Christ, the sun of righteousness, and what does this mean for us? Malachi 4:2-3 says the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts.\\n\\n\\nHe is the Sun - There is a twofold meaning of Christ as the Sun. The Gospel of John tells us that “In him was life, and the life was the light of men” (John 1:4). First, Christ is the source of true life. We know very well that without the energy of the sun, our world would be lifeless. And so without Christ, the source of life, we are all dead in our sins. Secondly, like the sun, Christ is a light that illuminates in our world of darkness. Christ’s perfect sacrifice casts out sin the same way that light drives out darkness, and upon this light we receive the foundation of our faith. As C.S. Lewis puts it, we believe in the sun not only because we see it but also because through it we see all things. Christ, being our light, leads those who were “darkened in their understanding” (Eph. 4:18) to Him, who is truth. \\n\\n\\nHe emanates righteousness - Christ shines forth nothing but righteousness. He was completely righteous when he lived and imputed righteousness unto his Church when he died. Paul writes in 2 Corinthians “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor. 5:21). And tied together with Christ’s righteousness is his justice as well. As it says in verse 2, the sun “shall rise” and it surely will continue to rise until its righteousness burns fully in the great day of judgement against those whose condemnation is just.\\n\\n\\nHe has healing in its wings - This is good news for those who fear His name. Because of Christ, unrighteous people who are otherwise blinded by the righteous Sun can find healing in His rays! Christ not only healed physical diseases, but He decisively defeated the spiritual sickness of sin. As Christ himself professed to the Pharisees, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Luke 5:32).\\n\\n\\nHe makes us leap - Before we received Christ, Malachi says that we were like “calves from the stall”, constricted in a pitch dark night. But when the sun rises, the calves can break free and leap towards the light ahead of them. This is a picture of our Gospel freedom from the moment we were saved up until now - we leap forwards with joy, no longer thinking about the stall we were once bound to but instead striving forwards toward nothing but the Light ahead.\\n\\n\\nHe defeats the wicked - In this world, we see deep injustice. One can easily point out examples where the wicked prosper while the righteous suffer. Yet Malachi points to a moment where “you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet”. We must read this carefully because this destructive punishment belongs to the Lord, who is Just; we see that the Lord says this will happen “on the day when I act”. When we crush the wicked below our feet, we are running through the aftermath of the Lord’s victory. On that final day, we will surely run as we, without question, marvel at the perfection of our Lord’s judgement. We shall run with joy as we celebrate His glory.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, within just these two verses we find the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sun of righteousness, prophesied by Malachi over 400 years before it happened. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. In your Gospel freedom, are you leaping forth to Christ like the claves released from the stall? Preach to your heart and pray that you may fix your gaze towards Christ every morning!\\n2.

Oftentimes, we hear Christians say that Psalms is their favorite book in Scripture, but we seldom hear the praises of Psalm 119 on their lips. Brothers and sisters, how often do we sing My soul is consumed with longing for your rules at all times (Psa. 119:20) or I open my mouth and pant because I long for your commandments (Psa. 119:131)? As we read in Malachi 3:6, God says “For I the Lord do not change” - this Psalm may come from the Old Testament, but it is never an “outdated” thing to delight in the Law! \\n\\n\\n\\nAs the book of Malachi comes to a close, we see a final appeal in verse 4 to “remember the law of my servant Moses, the statutes and rules that I commanded him at Horeb (which is Mt. Sinai) for all Israel”. This includes the 10 Commandments and other rituals or customs that set Israel apart. These laws reflect God’s character, reveal His perfect will, and are a guide for how we can enjoy our life as our Creator had intended. They are an invitation to trust God’s wisdom, but more than that, God himself promises through the Mosaic Covenant that “if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine” (Exo. 19:5). God’s sure guarantee for the blessing of His people is found in the Law! In a time where Judah is accusing God for abandoning His people and withholding true justice, there are many reasons why Malachi aptly declares that they must remember the Law. \\n\\n\\nThe Law exposes fallenness - If Judah truly remembered the Law, and if her priests truly walked in righteousness, it would be clear as day that her Lord is truly slow to anger and full of mercy and grace. Throughout the disputations in Malachi 1-3, the people of Judah are proven guilty of dishonoring God with worthless offerings, formalistic worship, and idolatrous marriages. Not only have they naturally brought destruction unto themselves through these inherently detestable acts, but they have broken priestly covenants, sacrificial covenants, and marital covenants. When these people ask “Where is the God of justice?” or claim “It is vain to serve God”, it is clear that they have forgotten the Law. Brothers and sisters, do not forsake the law! When we look upon the Law, it is like a mirror that reflects our inability to be faithful partners with the Lord. If we fail to remember the law, we fail to see the fallenness that drives us to run to the cross where we find our strong and perfect plea.\\n\\n\\nThe Law reflects the perfect will of God - Judah has truly forgotten the goodness of the Law. In her half-hearted pursuit of it, the Law has clearly become like a burdensome duty they must carry out to meet legal demands. These laws are not arbitrary! As we gaze upon God’s commandments, we have the privilege to witness His character, which ought to fill our souls with praise. Most evidently, they point to His Holiness; but on top of that, we see His Justice in the sacrificial laws, His Sufficiency in the Sabbath laws, His Faithfulness in the marriage laws, His Purity in the cleanliness laws, and His Grace in the sojourner laws. Brothers and sisters, when we read the Law or the 10 Commandments, do we just see things to “Do” and things to “Do not”? The Law was expressed to God’s chosen people in this way because they were so far from knowing who the Lord truly was. Yet because of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), we are no longer like babies who are only warned with negative “Do not” commands. Since Christ has fulfilled the Law (Matt. 1:17), we now know one positive command which the heartbeat behind it all. As God had promised through Moses, the Holy Spirit would circumcise our hearts “so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live” (Deut. 30:6). We now know that Malachi was right in both warning and encouraging Judah to stick to the Law - for through the Law and through Christ, we truly live fulfilled! \\n\\n\\nJesus said that “If you love Me keep My commandments” (John 14:15). Our Lord has given us many commands, and if we are merely trudging through them, we are missing out on something that ought to be our delight. We who are Christian, having experienced a new birth, now have deep affections for our Father and a desire to please Him. Remember that when the Lord told Ezekiel to eat the scroll, containing His words, it was “as sweet as honey” (Eze. 3:3). Brothers and sisters, let us remember the Law of Moses and sing loudly with the psalmist How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! (Psa. 119:103). \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. When you think upon the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ, does your heart leap forth in praise and joy like the psalmists in Psalm 119?\\n\\n2.

This Elijah is most likely the same messenger of chapter 3 verse 1, and he is the John the Baptist we see in the New Testament (Matthew 11:14). This Elijah will prepare for the Lord’s coming, the day of the Lord. He will announce to the world of the “great and awesome day of the Lord” (verse 5), and “he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers” (verse 6) so that in the day of the Lord, there will not be “utter destruction” (verse 6). What God is saying here in Malachi is that He will send Elijah to prepare the people so that they will be morally right with each other, and also with God — He uses the paternal relationship to show this (read the chapters prior and see that God has been continuously using decrepit human relations to show the fallen nature of man’s relationship with God).\\n\\n\\nWe have talked about the “day of the Lord” a couple times in the past devotionals, but I want to now talk about it with anticipation for the New Testament in a bit more detail as we near the end of the Old Testament.\\n\\n\\nThe phrase “day of the Lord \'\' is used a couple times throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament, and though some of them point to different immediate fulfillments, they ultimately prophesy the final day of the judgement, the Coming of Jesus. This is the same case in today’s passage — the “great and awesome day of the Lord” will be when Jesus finally unleashes His final judgement and those who of His Kingdom will rejoice while those outside will weep.\\n\\n\\nYet, if this Elijah will truly lead Israel to turn to God and repent as verse 6 says, where is Jesus’s incarnation and ministry in this picture — where is the person to whom Elijah will lead people to? From the time of the coming of Elijah to the day of the Lord, it seems almost as if the transition is immediate — if the ministry of Jesus is so crucial in justifying those who will stand in judgement, why is this not included? Furthermore, if in chapter 3 verse 1, we have seen that the Lord would come into His temple, and “the messenger of the covenant”, Jesus, would come. This seemed to point to His first coming, not just a second — where is that first coming?\\n\\n\\nThe day of the Lord, I believe, includes also the incarnation and ministry of Jesus. We must understand that the Second Coming is not equivalent to a “second ministry,” or a “second plan” of Jesus. That is, the Second Coming of Jesus is the completion of the work He has already finished on the cross. We understand the day of the Lord as the “already but not yet”. Jesus has established all righteousness and defeated death on the cross, and He has guaranteed life through His resurrection already, but not yet has He called His beloved and resurrected their bodies. Furthermore, as for the wicked, He has not yet tread them down (verse 3).\\n\\n\\nHowever, in addition to this later future event, I believe that Malachi is also referencing the end of the Jewish age that Jesus prophesied in Matthew 24-25. The Jewish covenant nation will come to pass in the destruction of the temple and of Jerusalem, and this will usher in the New Covenant age. This event did indeed happen very quickly after John the Baptist and the Christians who heeded Jesus’s warnings in Matthew were those who survived. In such a way, following the common pattern of the duality of prophecy, Malachi is foretelling of the destruction of Israel and the end of mankind — which makes sense concerning the accusations the Lord made against Israel in the last couple chapters. (Also look at Luke 21:20-24)\\n\\n\\nThis Elijah in the New Testament is the final human prophet who will turn back the hearts of the Israelites to the Lord. He is the bridge between the Old and the New Testament as He preaches of the day of the Lord when prophets will no longer be necessary. When the work on the cross is complete, there will be a completion of the sovereign justification of those God has selected. However, for the wicked, this day of the Lord will also be the sealing of their demise — “utter destruction” (verse 6).\\n\\n\\nJohn the Baptist is this last prophet Elijah because after the cross and the Pentecost, God will talk to every chosen man, and he will talk to God directly. The heart of the Father will be turned to His Children, and their hearts will be turned to the Father (verse 6). John will be the bridge because he will be the last to speak the Law to men (notice that verse 6 is showing the Law in human relationship — meaning that not yet has God adopted the elect), for after, the elect will be adopted to be a son like Christ (2 Samuel 7:14), and God will write the Law in their hearts (Jeremiah 31:33).\\n\\n\\nThis is the “great and awesome day of the Lord”. And for those who believed, the early Christians were the remnants of that day, and for current day Christians, they can look forward to that day of the Lord of His Second Coming.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Do you anticipate, eagerly await, and long for the day of the Lord?\\n\\n2. If we are in the “already but not yet” of the day of the Lord, are we feeling the urgency that we should feel?

In Malachi we saw the wrath of the Lord burn against Israel and the love of God that still glimmered for Israel. In 1 John, we will see the depths of that love that motivates us to live a life worthy of that love shown us through Christ.\\n\\nThe First Epistle of John is traditionally surmised to be the letter/message of Apostle John to Christians, most likely to a certain group of people. These letters would be circulated all throughout the various parts of the Roman empire amongst the Christian churches to be read to the congregations.\\n\\nThe epistle bears resemblance to the Gospel of John in using similar terminologies and concepts. The divinity of Jesus is emphasized, as well as viewing His ministry on earth as being one of tremendous victory. The topics of regeneration hint once again at the need for one to be reborn in order to believe — reminding us of John 3. This letter is a proclamation of the power of transformation through the work of the living, incarnate Jesus on the cross that testified of His love.\\n\\nThe letter seeks to exhort the readers with the love shown in Christ, while at the same time revealing the other side of the same coin — the need for Christians to stay holy and vigilant in the “last hours”. John explicitly addresses the concerns that he has regarding incorrect teachings (such as Docetism and Gnosticism) and evil spirits that profess not Christ, but human doctrines. Throughout the letter, even when addressing these concerns that he has for the Church, John also continuously reassures the Body of the Head’s leadership and His victory that allows also the Church to hold claim in that victory. The obvious focus of John throughout the letter is the victory and completion of all work on the cross, and our response thereof that results as an effect of our knowing of such truth and changed by such truth.\\n\\n1 John contains urging and encouragement to continue in the faith for the Church that was most likely going through suffering that would have pressured the Christians to turn to other doctrines or to live as hidden Christians who did not live out the Gospel they had come to believe in. Yet, though he knows that life will be difficult for these Christians, he also does not hold back from convicting the readers to the need to live out the commandments given us by God.\\n\\nPlease take this time to read over the whole of 1 John (it is very short) — it does not have to be examined in detail. Understanding the general structure and theme of the letter will help in analyzing it closely.\\n\\nHowever, while reading, just highlight interesting notes or questions. Also, if there is a burning question, please email Handa (hchun@princeton.edu), we will make sure to answer it in our devotionals (or if it is really burning, we will answer immediately — let us know).

I believe the ESV did a great job of parsing the punctuation-less Koine Greek into English, but some clarification is always helpful.\\n\\nFor this reason, below is an annotated version of the same passage:\\n\\n1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life— 2 the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us— 3 that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.\\nThe red highlight portion of the passage is what I will call the “content” of the epistle of John, and the purple highlighted portion I will call the “reason” for writing the epistle of John. The yellow and green portions are the explanations of the words “word” and “life” respectively.\\n\\nFirstly, we can read the red portions as such: “concerning the word of life [...] that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you”. John is setting the stage and giving an introduction to what he will be talking about for the rest of the letter. He will be telling them of the “word of life” that they have “seen and heard”. They, most likely the witnesses to Jesus, chiefly the Apostles (as shown by the usage of the word “we”), will not only hold onto the Gospel for themselves, but will share it to the world — specifically to the brothers in faith. This shows the “content” of the message that John wants to convey in his letter to the brothers and sisters in the faith. This “content” is the “word of life” (verse 1) which allows us to recollect event in the Gospel of John when Peter testifies of Jesus having the “words of eternal life” (John 6:68).\\n\\nYet, what is this “word of life”? John explains quite well in two sections of his massive sentence. I will explain it by separating the “word” from “life” separately as John seems to explain in the yellow section the “word” (technically and syntactically, the whole of “word of life”, but for the form and simplicity, I will separate to show the component nature of his sentence) while explaining in the purple section, the “life” that modifies “word”.\\n\\nThe yellow section explaining “word” talks about this word as having been “from the beginning” — reminding us of “In the beginning was the Word” (John 1:1). In doing so, John is showing that this word that they want to proclaim to the readers is in fact Christ Himself — the Son of God. This is the Word who they have heard, have seen, and have looked upon and touched (verse 1) — the Son of Man. John wants to make it clear to the audience that this word that they preach is not just a theory that they worked out, or a knowledge that they have procured, but the Messiah Himself. From “which we have heard” to “[...] with our hands”, John is reiterating his Gospel, “the Word became flesh” (John 1:14). He sees that it is so important that this is the actual incarnate Jesus that John places these descriptive phrases in front of even the “content” of the whole letter.\\n\\nNext, the green section describes “life”. If “word” was describing the person of Jesus, “life” here explains the essence of that “word”. As the “word” showed the way in which Jesus manifested, the “life” shows the completion of all things that happened as a result of Jesus’s manifestation. John, in the first couple words of verse 2, quite simply puts that the very essence of “life” was “made manifest”. Once again, John says “we have seen it” — and John is not being redundant, but He is being adamant. He is being adamant that not only was Jesus truly God who had also taken on flesh as shown in the yellow section, but in the green section, he shows that Jesus was also the giver of life, and in Him was life. There is nothing taken away from Jesus of His deity because He was truly man, and His life was not tarnished, but rather this life was communicated and given to mankind — “made manifest”. This was not some esoteric knowledge, but was something even the disciples could “see” and “testify” and “proclaim”. It was not mere facts or spiritual feeling, but “eternal life” that actually brings transformation — which only belongs to the Father, yet was made manifest to the Church. Quite readily, we can see that John is making an attack and a defense against the Docetists who believed not in the real incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus.\\n\\nFinally, in the purple section, we see the “reason” why John is proclaiming the “word of life”. John wants the readers to “have fellowship” with the rest of the Body. This fellowship is important not just because it is a comfortable group that people can hang out with. It is not a picture of a vibrant modern evangelical church with a coffee shop on the first floor and a basketball court in the annex. No, the distinguishing part of the fellowship as shown in our passage is firstly, that “our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ” (verse 3). The second part of this fellowship, as we will see later on, is again, not a “welcoming environment” but a striving love between the brothers and sisters, and a struggling towards the goal as a result of that love. This fact is emphasized again with the last verse of our passage — the reason they write can be summarized by saying that the believers write because it is in their desire to fulfill their joy in the fellowship with God and with the Body.\\n\\nThis is the summary and intent of John for this epistle. It is that the true word of life that shows a Jesus who actually lived and died and rose would be preached to bring brothers and sisters to God in fullness of joy.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Have we made Christ into a phantasmic character in a fantastic plot? Do we truly believe in a real Jesus?\\n2. What is the word of life?\\n"},"name":"day65"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"1 John 1:5-7: Walking in the Light\\n\\nMay 27, 2020\\n\\n\\n5 This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nToday’s passage serves as a “litmus test” for its readers. To those that are in Christ, affirmation of a true and honest relationship with Christ is given. However, to those who are not truly saved, today’s passage gives an unabashed warning of a false hope and false belief. This morning, let each one of us perform this litmus test on ourselves. \\n\\n\\nBefore going through with this test, we must know what the foundation of this test is. And verse 5 gives it to us clearly: “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” That is, there cannot be darkness where there is light, and the source of this light is God Himself. He (the light) exposes the sin and evil hidden in the darkness, and His holiness starkly contrasts this evil. \\n\\n\\nThen, the litmus test in today’s passage is simply a logical conclusion of God being light. And the conclusion is this: we will walk in the light if we have fellowship with the God who is light, and we will walk in the darkness otherwise. \\n\\n\\nJohn begins with those that walk in the darkness. One cannot walk in the darkness if they know the God who is light, and those that are in the darkness should thus examine themselves. What does it mean to be in the darkness? It is more than to simply walk in sin. In the darkness, it is difficult to differentiate between a normal rock and a precious stone. That is, someone who is walking in the darkness cannot see the folly in the desires of this world and cannot see the joy and beauty that is found in Christ alone. \\n\\n\\nLet us then ask ourselves this morning if we walk in the darkness. Do we truly see the evil in chasing after the ways of this world and see the joy in serving Christ, or do we instead see Christianity as some sort of restraint for the things we want to do? Can we honestly say that we find joy in the message of Christ and have the ability to repeat with the apostle Paul: “for me to live is Christ and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21)? \\n\\n\\nContrasting this darkness is the light, and walking in it. What does it mean to walk in the light? John gives us two things that accompany walking in the light in verse 7: fellowship with one another and the blood of Christ that cleanses us from all sin. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, do we claim to walk in the light? If so, can we honestly say that we are walking with other brothers and sisters that are in the light, devoted to His kingdom? Can we say that we live as those that are dead to sin and being cleansed from it daily? \\n\\n\\nIf not, brothers and sisters, let us hesitate no longer and come before the God who is light. But for those that are walking in the light, let us give thanks to God, for today’s passage assures us that those that walk in the light are those that know the God who is light! \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Are you walking in the light or in the darkness?\\n\\n2. For those that are not in the light, let us not hesitate and instead come before the Father this morning. For those that are in the light, let us lift a song of joyous thanks!

In today’s passage, John tells of another mark of a true believer: the continual confession and repentance of sins. \\n\\n\\nJohn begins this idea by mentioning those that “say [they] have no sin” in verse 8. When we read this verse, we may quickly excuse ourselves from this group of people, assuring ourselves that we don’t think in this manner. However, we must realize that when we do not confess our sins before the Father, we implicitly express that we have no sin. \\n\\n\\nFor those that do confess their sins, John assures that “[God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” John is not talking about being forgiven or no longer being unrighteous in the sense of justification. Jesus has died for every sin, once and for all, for those that believe in Him. \\n\\n\\nWhat is the forgiveness and cleansing that John is talking about then? The key to understanding this lies in our relationship with God as believers. As believers, we are now to strive after holiness and Christ-likeness because we love Him and want to serve Him. And when we sin, this same love drives us to repentance because we have sinned against the one that we love and long to serve. Therefore, as believers, we do not repent in order to be forgiven and loved, but because we are already forgiven and loved. This is why the continual confession and repentance of sin is a mark of a true believer. \\n\\n\\nThus, the forgiveness and cleansing that John is talking about is in the sense of sanctification. What a great assurance we have in verse 9, then! The Almighty God has not only forgiven us of our sins, but promises to constantly renew us and cleanse us from our ongoing sins, that we may one day be holy. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, in our struggles against sin, let us not lose heart! For God has not left us alone after saving us, but He has promised to ceaselessly cleanse us from our sins. Let us come before our Father this morning and confess our sins, that we may be renewed. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Do you continually confess and repent of your sins? \\n\\n2. Do you feel alone or forsaken in your struggles against sin?

But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nThese few verses may sound like things that we already know, but they must be stored up as treasure in our hearts. John reminds us today that “if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”. Commit this verse to memory, for there will come many days where this truth will be crucial as you are overwhelmed by the guilt of your sin. For while we grow in Christ, our frequency of sin may diminish, but the miserableness of our sin will intensify. \\n\\n\\nThe instant we are born again, our desires and affections are wholly transformed. We can no longer boast loudly of sins in front of our friends nor spend long hours planning out a sinful act without grieving our conscience. We quickly swallow the addictive pill of sin in the moment only to find a bitter aftertaste. As we journey toward the Light, we begin to spot stains of sin splattered everywhere in our lives. In every thought, in every motive, and in our daily masquerade, we realize that we are sinners not because we act sinfully, but we act sinfully because we are by nature such depraved sinners. And the closer we get with Christ, the deeper our guilt cuts and the sharper our betrayal stings.\\n\\n\\nThe apostle John, now an elder, makes it clear to his congregation of “little children” that he is “writing these things to [them] so that [they] may not sin”. We must understand the filthiness of sin, corrupts all the love, the life, and the fellowship that John writes about. It is from here that we look back onto ourselves and see that we saints are still sinners, and mighty ones, feeding into the corruption of our fallen world. Brothers and sisters, you will battle the world, you will battle the devil, but you will also battle with the flesh, which is yourself! There will be a day where your wretched sin will haunt your growing spiritual sensitivities in a terrifying way. You will feel so disgusted, so worthless, so like an imposter to the faith! Your flesh may accuse you and ask After all these years of sanctification and are you back at square one? \\n\\n\\nWhen days like these come, and surely they will, we must reach for this treasure of a verse: “if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”. If we are to respond rightly, we must remember “square one” and remember how we first looked upon Christ our Advocate with nothing but helplessness. Fellow Christians, in our journey of sanctification, have we developed spiritual pride and found comfort in our own righteousness? Our sanctification is not our justification! We should want nothing to do with the righteousness of ourselves and everything to do with the righteousness of Christ - our spiritual progress should never replace the life, the death, and the resurrection of our Savior. Remember that the Advocate we had when we were first saved is the same Advocate we have today. Christ is not just our Advocate once; since John is writing to those already Christian, it must be that our Lord is our Advocate again and again. We should never think that we have fallen so hard or so often to have exhausted all opportunity to look upon Him another time. Oh the scandal of this grace, that when we think we have thrown it all away, upon Christ our sin is laid once more, for “he is the propitiation of our sins”! You may ask How is it fair that I am lavished with such grace? but remember that our advocate is Jesus Christ the righteous, and so He pleads for us in a way that is perfectly good. \\n\\n\\nSo when sin haunts and accuses us, let us remember how we turned our eyes upon Jesus when we first met Him and do it again! We are to look upon Him as a helpless and poor sinner. Shake off your spiritual pride daily. For without Christ, we are like Princetonians condemned and expelled by the Honor Code or elected officials exposed and incarcerated of their fraudulence. Do not think we are any better for our transgressions are far worse. Yet by grace alone we have an Advocate! So when sin comes to haunt you, run and hide in the rock of Christ for protection and sing Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to the cross I cling! And just as he brought us from dead to life, with hope we look upon Christ who will surely renew us in our hopelessness. Brothers and sisters, let us proclaim this loudly so that his scattered Church may hear: though he hates sin, Jesus Christ is a friend of sinners! He offers propitiation not only for my sin “but also for the sins of the whole world”!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. When was the last time you were utterly crushed by the weight of your sinfulness? How did you respond? Should you have responded differently?\\n\\n2. Do you struggle with the idea that you are unworthy to be forgiven once more? Or do you instead struggle with seeing a desperate need for an Advocate?

That is, the relationship is like that of one doing certain work under command and authority of another. One side of the relationship holds a certain responsibility to the other while the other side holds some form of authority and power over the other.\\n\\nAgain, as in the past three devotionals that we studied together, we are to understand that even this relationship is supposed to be a reflection of God’s relationship. Particularly, the slave-master relationship is seen as a relationship that we have with God. God is repeatedly, in both the Old and the New Testament, shown as our master. Knowing now that this relationship of being a servant to God lives in conjunction with the fact that we also have a relationship to God that is like that of wife to a husband and child to parents, how are we to understand that our relationship with God is reflected in our relationship with our “earthly masters”?\\n\\nFirstly, in our obedience to “earthly masters” (verse 5), whether they be employers or teachers, we are to see our need to obey the Lord Jesus who is above all authority and power. As Psalm 123:2 shows, “as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master”, we are to look to God “till he has mercy upon us.” It may seem unsettling that we are “slaves to God”, and may seem like we are losing control, but in reality, all of us are under some control. Before we were saved, we were slaves to sin (Romans 6:16), but we have been bought and have now become slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:18). As Psalmist also says, we have become servants to the Lord: “I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.” (Psalm 116:16). We were always slaves to something in our lives. At first, we were slaves to sin and death, and now we have become slaves to God and righteousness.\\n\\nSecondly, we are to see how we need to worship and serve God from the core of our hearts. Knowing that we are serving God and not man, now we understand that we once served our “masters” because of our desire to serve something other than God — that is, we served our own evil motives, but now, we have the ability to be able to do all things in enslavement to righteousness. We can serve God truly even in the works that we do for others, and we can obey our earthly masters “with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart” (verse 5) because we fear the Lord. We are serving “with fear and trembling” no longer because the earthly master can take away our food or wages, but we serve our earthly masters because in such a way we remember our master who has authority over more than our bodily lives (Matthew 10:28).\\n\\nWe do not do work merely “by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers” (verse 6) as the Samaritans did to avoid punishment (2 Kings 17:29-41), but we work “with a sincere heart” (verse 5) because we know that we are doing it to render “service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man” (verse 7). We can do the “will of God from the heart” (verse 6) because we know that “whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord” (verse 8). We have all been given different talents on this earth, and we are to be diligent in the talents we have been given because we are given gifts in heaven according to how we exercised our talents given to us on earth (Matthew 25:14-30). Truly, in heaven, those of us who exercised our talents for the Lord (and that is only possible for those who are mastered by the Lord) will receive the greatest gift of His joy: “Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master” (Matthew 25:23).\\n\\nThirdly, we are to see, from the imperfection of our “earthly masters”, the need for our perfect Master who is in heaven. Despite the commands of verse 9, we know that our earthly masters do not reflect the Master in heaven. They seem to either not know or forget that our Master and theirs in heaven are the same, and only on earth they are practicing some form of authority and power over us — even their temporary power is given to them through God’s sovereignty. David was one such character in the Bible who was even hunted down by his master Saul. Our earthly masters must do their best to emulate the love of God and His perfect position of being the Master, but they often are much too weak to do so, or are unwilling. What must those under such authority do at such a point? Are we to revolt and hate them and not follow the above verses 5-8?\\n\\nThe answer is similar to what we discussed yesterday regarding our parents. Though they may not be perfect, we endure their abuse or insufferable behavior knowing that we are doing the best we can on our side to try to reflect God in our lives. If they abuse us, we still endure knowing that Christ endured abuse and tyrannical rule of the Roman justice system and the Jewish priests. If they slander us and refuse us our rights, we look to Christ again who was blasphemed against by the Pharisees. As long as we are not being forced to take sides against God, we endure as Christ endured for it will not be long as we serve the God who we so very need (Romans 8:18-19) We can hope because we have a great Master who has gone before us to prepare for us a house (John 14:2).\\n\\nWe, as Christians, know that this visible world is not all there is to it. We also know that all this world was created to reflect the order existent in God. So, even in the strangest and toughest of obediences required, let us hold fast knowing that God is the true Master we are serving, our hearts can truly be worshipful in obedience thanks to God, and knowing we have a great master who is preparing for us a great reward.\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, some of us may not know if we will even have earthly masters to serve as we graduate, but even still, let us hold fast knowing that we always have a kind Master caring for us.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How can we serve God in our works? Specifically, how can you in what you are given?\\n2.

We needed redemption for our trespasses (Eph 1:7) not just because we were uncomfortable in it, nor even because we were screaming for help in it, but rather because we were dead in it (verse 1). We were dead people with dead souls and bodies headed for death kept alive by the temporary common grace of God. We deserved nothing but the wrath and judgement of God.\\n\\nNot only this, but we followed “the course of the world,” meaning we walked with the rest of the world that had fallen. The world, signifying all those who do not know God and do not follow Him, then must follow someone else — that is, the prince of the power of the air, Satan (verse 2). For all those who walk not in the way, the truth, and the life that is Christ (John 14:6), they must walk in the way of the world and thereby walk with Satan — this means that they are actively against God. In this way, those who are not the sons of God can only be “the sons of disobedience” (verse 2).\\n\\nPaul goes on to describe what it means to be the sons of disobedience.\\n\\nFirstly, we “lived in the passions of our flesh” (verse 3). When the Bible talks about flesh, it is not just talking about our body, as it is clarified in the next couple words: “carrying out the desires of the body and the mind”. Rather, it’s pointing to the sin nature within us that inherently cannot meet the standards of God, and not only that, but desires otherwise as we set ourselves above God. Both in our bodies and minds, we lived, or rather, were dead, separated from God’s goodness. We desired not God, but with all our body and mind, we lived out our own desires that are evil.\\n\\nSecondly, we were “by nature children of wrath” — by nature! Since the Fall (Genesis 3, Romans 5:12), we were born in iniquity (Psalm 51:5), and we were individuals deserving only of the inheritance of God’s wrath — children of wrath. Not only that, but those who are born in sin, inheriting wrath, can only repeat sin and wrath, and therefore, all we produced was evil in this world, “like the rest of mankind” (verse 3).\\n\\nMankind was fallen — dead.\\n\\nYet, verse 1 tells us that we were dead (for the skeptic, this is correct in Greek as well when read in context of the entire sentence). We once were dead, but now we were alive, and Paul goes on to describe in the next couple verses how God saved us.\\n\\nThough we are not, the rest of this world is dead. We as Christians exclusively walk as living people in a world full of dead people — those with spiritual life and awaiting resurrection life. You see, we have no death to fear even in this time of a pandemic disease because death for those who are alive in Christ merely means a resurrected body that will live forever in God’s goodness. Not so for those who do not believe — they will resurrect, but not to life in God, but to contempt and wrath (Daniel 12:2).\\n\\nHow should we respond in such a time as this? In time such as in the book of Esther when no one seems to know God, Christians need to rise up in “such a time as this” (Esther 4:14). As the Christians did in the times of pestilence from the Antonine Plague in Rome to COVID-19 in Wuhan, let’s take up their example and love others when they need it the most. We can love because we have been loved by Christ. Perhaps we have been sent home “for such a time as this”.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How were you (specifically) dead before you knew Christ? \\n\\n2.

Yet among these people, there are those who know that they obey His commandments and know that they know Him when in reality they neither know Him nor walk in obedience to Him. \\n\\n\\n\\nHow can this be so? Simply put, they perceive Jesus to be someone He is not and think that keeping His commandments is nothing more than the formalism of kindness, worship and church attendance.

When John calls out false believers for being a liar, it is often the case that they are lying to themselves. These people have a wrong perception of Christ and His Commandments.\\n\\n\\nWrong Perception of Christ \\n\\nFrom the apostolic age until now, people have continually been deceived by man-made images of Jesus. \\n\\n\\nThink about Judas Iscariot. It was not obvious to any of the other disciples that he was the traitor. As a disciple of Christ, who cast out demons in his name, Judas probably thought that he knew who Christ was. Perhaps Judas pictured Christ as someone who would make him powerful or prosperous in the world only to find in anger that his earthly treasures were reduced to nothing. Whatever it was, Judas had his own perception of who Christ was and where he stood in relation to Him. \\n\\n\\nWhen John wrote this epistle, he was dealing with the emerging belief of Gnosticism which claimed that Christ was only a spirit that seemed to take on human form. And today, some think Jesus is a political revolutionary while others think he is a fountain for financial blessing. Brothers and sisters, we must come to know the Biblical Christ. He is the God-exalting, wrath-absorbing Lamb of unconditional Love who takes away the Sin of the world! This can only happen if we study the Bible prayerfully and comprehensively. Selectively reading and interpreting the Bible can be dangerous. Scripture is the Word of God and thus forms a wholly unified and consistent framework for reality - does your understanding of Jesus fit in harmoniously with everything else the Bible says? \\n\\n\\nWrong Perception of His Commandments \\n\\nJohn writes in verse 4 that “Whoever says ‘I know him’ but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him”. Brothers and sisters, let us look to what Christ said to the rich young ruler (Matt. 19:16-22). Regarding His commandments, the ruler confidently proclaimed “all these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?”. Yet when Christ challenged him to give all he had to the poor and follow Him, the young ruler sorrowfully went away. Though he thought that he was obedient to Christ’s commands, upon closer examination we see that his love for Christ was overshadowed by his love for money. Brothers and sisters, do we make the same mistake? When we think that we are walking with Christ as friendly individuals, are we really just bringing down His standards of love? \\n\\n\\nWhen followers come to hear what His commandments truly entail, many end up turning away. Thus, those who know Him “walk in the same way in which he walked” having understood what walking with Christ requires of them. In John 6, crowds of people ran after Jesus after he had miraculously fed the five thousand, but after hearing Him preach the truth, “many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him” (John 6:66). Yet some continued to follow, like Simon Peter, who said, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God” (John 6:67-69). Brothers and sisters, though Peter will come to an even greater knowledge of the Love of Christ, this is already an example of someone who truly knows who Christ is and keeps His commandments as a result.\\n\\n\\nLet us all strive to walk in the way of obedience having understood truly who Christ is and what He commands of us. Pay close attention to the instructions of Christ, speaking directly to you through the Word. Pay close attention to the walk of Christ so that you can understand how to follow in His footsteps. Pay close attention to the Love of Christ, for John later writes “this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must love his brother”. Fellow Christians, through it all, be joyful, for as we press forth in obeying His commandments, we gain the blessed assurance that “we have come to know him”. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What is it that Christ commands of you? When you hear a command like “love one another”, have you brought its standards down so as to foster complacency?"},"name":"day69"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"1 John 2:18-19: They Were Not of Us\\nJune 4, 2020\\n\\n18 Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. \\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nWhen hearing of the antichrist or antichrists, we often imagine some figure out of horror movies. If Jesus was perfectly loving and good, then we imagine the antichrist to be a heinous, evil being that none will want to follow. This morning, let our view on the antichrist and antichrists be shaped by Scripture alone, rather than horror movies or our own imaginations. \\n\\nIn verse 18, John indicates that there is not only an “antichrist,” but also many “antichrists” that have already come. We see from other parts of 1 John (1:7, 2:22, 4:3) that antichrists are those that deny that Jesus is God and that He came in the flesh. These antichrists are not the demon-like figures that are seen in horror movies; they are deceivers that can overturn a church from the inside out if proper doctrine is not upheld. \\n\\nWhat does this mean for us? First, we must be vigilant in our doctrine and what we believe. John makes it clear that antichrists will expose themselves in verse 19 by not “continuing” with the believers in their faith. That is, the best defense against such antichrists is to be firm in what we believe as Christians and to continue to live out the faith in steadfastness. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, how can we do this if we do not constantly read and study the Word? How can we constantly be rooted in the truth if we do not daily return to the Scriptures, the source of truth, in meditation and prayer?  It is not enough to simply hear the Word on Sunday or read these devotionals in the morning, for we have the rest of the days to be swayed by the teachings of this world and of the antichrists. Rather, we must constantly root ourselves in the truth of the Word. \\n\\nAnd how can we stand together as believers and see those who go out from among us as antichrists (verse 19) if we do not have fellowship with other believers? Let us not stand alone on an island, ready to be swayed to and fro by the surrounding waves. Rather, let us all seek fellowship with one another, brothers and sisters, that we may build each other up and hold steadfastly to the faith together. \\n\\nThe second thing for us to note from all of this is that “it is the last hour” (verse 18). Many deceivers have come into this world already, leading to great distortions of the Christian faith. Many calamities have overtaken this world, leaving all of creation groaning for the return of the Messiah that will restore everything perfectly. \\n\\nTherefore, brothers and sisters, let us keep watch for the return of our Lord. Let us not be like those among the ten virgins that were unprepared for the coming of the bridegroom (Matthew 25:1-13), but instead let us daily prepare ourselves for His return. As the bride of Christ, let us beautify ourselves for this great day by letting the Holy Spirit sanctify us daily. \\n\\nThe hour is soon. Let us wait in anticipation for the return of our King. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you study the Word for yourself and deeply meditate on it?\\n2. Do you have fellowship with other believers (not just friendship, but building one another up in Christ)? \\n3. Are you ready for the return of the Messiah?

However this does not take away from the crucial message he is trying to get across but rather better emphasizes it. Along with utilising parallelism in his address, John writes the first three couplets in present tense and the rest in past tense or in greek aorist. (2) Doing so helps John speak more meaningfully to the three demographics he addresses: little children, fathers, and young men. Also to fully grasp the significance of this message and deeper meaning behind what John is saying, we must remember John’s message from the last chapter leading up to this. Before going on, try recalling on your own what John’s message was up until this point.\\n\\n\\nFrom Chapter 1, John is very critical towards false claims that people may have been making. In Chapter 1 verse 6, he clarifies that if you claim to be in fellowship with God but walk in darkness, you are lying and do not practice the truth. No ifs ands or buts. Similarly in Chapter 1 verse 8, he clarifies that if you claim to have no sin, you are deceiving yourself and also do not have the truth in you. What John is saying is very important and cannot be taken lightly. Many today, even Christians, may be outraged by these statements since we are apparently “in no place to judge whether someone is a Christian” but John backs his bold claims in Chapter 2. From the start, John emphasizes how he is mainly writing in order to help us not to sin, but when we do, to turn to Jesus Christ who is “the propitiation for our sins.” Verses 12-14 are now a continuation of the message about our identity in Christ: discussing assurance for God’s people. \\n\\nThis section is the only part in 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John where John writes in a Hebrew poem style. He uses external parallelism among the six couplets, changing the tense from present to aorist, to address and reassure the readers who are in the body of Christ. gravfw or “I am writing”, used in the first three couplets, takes on the definition of what he is writing right now. In the last three couplets, the aorist is used when John writes egraya or “I have written.” The past or aorist is mainly used to refer to something written previously. While the use of the aorist later in 3 John will, with great certainty, mean a reference to a previously written message, in this context it is a safe assumption to believe John is referencing his current writing in 1 John due to some key observations. The key details that should be considered are the content that is being presented and the order John presents them in. In the message that John gives, the repetition of key ideas is rather obvious and actually done with good reason, but this will be more deeply discussed when covering the demographics he speaks to. The repetition of ideas coupled with the fact that John first addresses the readers with what he is writing right now before referencing a previous work (3) gives us the ability to safely assume John is referencing his current work, 1 John. The usage of poetic devices has a greater meaning than stylistic preferences. (For more clarification on the latter statement, check the footnote) \\n\\nNow given this premise, we can dig deeper into what his message is and what impact his poetic devices have. The overarching message is primarily that His word will never cease. Not as briefly mentioned earlier, John addresses three demographics: little children, fathers, and young men. John’s usage of specifically these three groups can be understood by looking at the life of a Christian.\\n\\nThe first group addressed, little children, actually has a deeper meaning than most would assume. In verse 12, John uses teknia meaning “a child young in age” and in the third couplet of verse 13, paidia meaning “a child young in experience and therefore in need of training and discipline.” The straightforward interpretation is that John is talking about the physical age of an individual, but considering his poetic elements and the entirety of his message, this interpretation is rather weak. The more structured and supported interpretation that I subscribe to is that John is referring to all Christians when saying little children. In the present tense message to little children, John addresses the fundamental beliefs a regenerated Christian would hold fast to, “because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake,” and in the aorist he provides assurance that we can be confident in God’s blessings to us “because you know the Father.” Furthermore, those who are regenerated and saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone are God’s children and as the book of Matthew says (4), hence we enter the kingdom of Heaven. So this assurance is not just for infants but rather all Christians.\\n\\nThe meaning behind John’s usage of fathers and young men is more flexible regarding two interpretations. The first interpretation that is acceptable when reading through an exegetical lens is that both fathers and young men reference all Christians just as little children. However  another interpretation, which I subscribe to, that also is acceptable when reading through an exegetical lens is that John is talking about two different groups. To fathers, John’s message in both the present and aorist is the same, “because you know him who is from the beginning.” Notice how this is the only message that is identically repeated in both tenses. Usually in scripture when repetition is used, its purpose is to emphasize what is written. (5) Fathers when compared to young men are the more mature individuals, but because they have more experience and have spent more time fighting the spiritual battle they may also be more prone to being burnt out or losing focus on what started it all. Thus John\'s repeated message can be interpreted as a strong message of encouragement and assurance to always remember how they have the greatest gift in the world: to know God.\\n\\nFollowing this premise, looking at the last group addressed, young men, completes the beautiful message John writes. John’s message to young men also incorporates repetition to give off a convicting message: John is writing to them “because you have overcome the evil one” and writes “because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.” In the aorist, John’s message assures young men who they are in Christ: strong, have overcome the evil one, and has the word of God in them. In the present, John’s message acts as a reminder to young men right now that they “have overcome the evil one” through Christ in them. The repetition specifically of overcoming the evil one marks its importance to young men who are still growing in maturity but may have zeal and vigor. Given the commonality of zeal and spontaneity or shakiness when facing difficulty in spiritually maturing men, this interpretation of John’s encouragement makes sense as an emphasis on how the battle is already won through Christ is especially needed for growing Christians. So through Him alone, we can have faith in the blessings he has granted us.\\n\\n1. http://www4.westminster.edu/staff/nak/courses/BibPoetry.htm\\n2. The Vulgate, or principal Latin version of the Bible, translates both in the present tense. However in the LXX or Septuagint, the present tense (γράφω) or “I am writing” is used in the first three couplets and the aorist tense (ἔγραψα) or “I have written” is used in the last three couplets.\\n3. The normal and expected order given these tenses would be to first reference the previous work and then utilise the present tense. (i.e. “I write to you about something in the past you may have read and now I am writing to you to address something.” would make sense and is the normal present->aorist but if you say “I am writing to you to address something and now I write to you about something in the past you may have read,” given the meanings of the greek tenses, the latter would not make that much sense and would probably be translated to “I am writing to you to address something and now I write to you about that something.” (Notice how this new translation would repeat the same information in both tenses.) Hence the latter interpretation is supported by the fact that John uses repetition in both tenses.\\n4. “and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” - Matthew 18:3-4; “but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” - Matthew 19:14\\n5. An example is in Isaiah 6 when the prophet Isaiah encounters God in a vision: he hears the angels singing “Holy, Holy, Holy.” When something is repeated three times it takes it to the superlative degree so “Holy, Holy, Holy” can be translated to “Holy, Holier, Holiest.” (Explained by Dr. Steven Lawson in the beautiful film American Gospel: Christ Crucified)\\n\\nConsider\\n1.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nAre you in love with the world? \\n\\nThis has become such common rhetoric for so many Christians that when we read this question, we may be tempted to simply answer “no” and move along. However, we see today that John does not simply say “do not love the world,” but he instead elaborates on what this truly means. Perhaps, then, it is best for us to take a closer look at this question as well. \\n\\nFirst, John begins with the firm statement in verse 15 that anyone who loves the world does not have the “love of the Father.” Note that what is in contention in this verse is our love. We will serve the one that we love, and we either love the Father or the things of this world. Brothers and sisters, let us choose today whom we will love and serve, for we can only choose one: God or the world. \\n\\nBut what does “loving the world” really mean? John tells us in verse 16 that it is to have “the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life.” That is, loving the world means to long and chase after the sinful, enticing ways of this world and abide by its principles rather than God’s. It is to build our life around the worldly idea of puffing ourselves up with achievements and social status rather than advancing the Kingdom of God. It is to cave to the growing desire to get drunk or to have sex rather than submitting before the Father and asking the Holy Spirit to help us when we are tempted. It is to take and eat of the apple as Eve did in the Garden of Eden because it was a “delight to her eyes” (Genesis 3:15). \\n\\nSo let us carefully ask ourselves again this morning. Are we in love with the world? \\n\\nDo we define success as the world does? Do we think highly of the one that commits each day to lifting up the banner of the Kingdom of God, or do we instead hold the brightest, kindest, most charming people in the highest regard?\\n\\nDo we define Christianity as the world does? Do we think that we are good Christians because we act kindly, hang out with other Christians, and don’t curse, drink, and party like others do? Or do we instead set our standard of Christianity to be Christ Himself, where we are ever desiring to become more like Him? \\n\\nFinally, let us remember the great folly in loving the world. We mustn’t view the things of this world as desirable, only restraining ourselves because God told us not to chase after such things, like a dog on a leash. Rather, we must see the folly in loving the world in order to stop loving it. \\n\\nIn verse 17, John tells us of this folly: “the world is passing away along with its desires.” Brothers and sisters, whenever we are tempted to love the world, let us look through the lens of eternity and see that nothing will remain but what we have built up for the Kingdom of God. Let us remember that in the lens of eternity, nothing matters but how we love and serve the eternal God. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Let us commit this morning to loving and serving God alone. \\n2.

John could merely say, “Those who are in the light will love his brother, those who are in the darkness will hate the brothers. However, John expands his discourse to make sure the reader understands absolutely what he means to say.\\n\\n\\nFirstly, in verse 9, we see that anyone who claims to be in the light, that is in Christ, but does not love his brothers (who are also Christ’s brothers) are “still in darkness”. This could mean two things. It could firstly mean that those who claim to be believers but do not love their fellow believers are not Christians at all. Secondly, with a less severe note, it could mean that those who claim to be believers but do not love their fellow believers are still resting in the darkness that they no longer belong.\\n\\n\\nTo this, I would assert that John is probably meaning to convey both interpretations of the message. That is, those who are truly indulgent of their lack of love for their brothers and are not repulsed by their own actions are most likely truly in and of darkness. At the same time, John is jolting those who are truly believers but lacking love to snap out of their egotistical method of faith and come out of the darkness in which they do not belong.\\n\\n\\nThis leads us to the next verse, verse 10. This seems to better support the second perspective and interpretation of verse 9 — because only a believer could understand it. It commands and assures that to love is the better resolution as it shows that he “abides in the light” and such love prepares his heart that there is “no cause for stumbling” (verse 10).\\n\\n\\nOnly a fellow member of the Church can truly love the members of the Church. I do not mean merely like and find amiable those belonging to the Church — that is far from real love and even unbelievers can “like” those of Christian faith. No, rather I mean a genuine love that is borne out of a regenerated heart that has been bought by the love of Christ (1 John 4:19). This phileo love that is true can only be shown within the Church because the world, on the other hand, hates the Church (Matthew 10:22). Only those who love truly have the light in them.\\n\\n\\nAnd those who have this love to show and to receive will not stumble because they have understood love and thereby understood the work of Christ. This does not mean we will never stumble, but it certainly does mean that as long as we reside and abide in love, we will not stumble. Yet, of course, we are still sinners and as long as we live, we will stumble, but God will lift us up again and again.\\n\\n\\nThen, we hear of those who hate their brothers in verse 11. This is the identity of those who do not believe, and therefore, it is also the category that if a believer ever finds himself in it, he must run out of. Those who hate their own fellow adopted brothers are in darkness. This is something we cannot ever take lightly (no pun intended). If you are truly in Christ and know the light yet are turned back from Christ to walk in darkness, you are in danger of unrepentant sin. If you are walking in darkness and do not know where the light is, your eyes are still blind and hence not saved. Either way, you are in a precarious predicament.\\n\\n\\nIf for some reason a so-called Christian hates the Church, the danger described in verse 11 is extremely severe. This person “does not know where he is going” (verse 11). Clearly, John is not talking about a physical journey, but the spiritual, but the allusion to the physical clarifies quite a bit what he means to convey. If a traveller walks in darkness, he is blinded, and therefore, naturally, he does not know where he is going.\\n\\n\\nFor those who read John’s account of the Gospel, this would have immediately raised serious concerns in his mind. If Jesus is the way (John 14:9), then to not know where to go would mean utter destruction as it means the said individual does not know Christ.\\n\\n\\nIt is not for a supplementary elective of the Christian religion that John wrote this urgent letter, but for a matter of the utmost qualification for those in Christ. Those who have received the love of Jesus to be called His brother must also love the other brothers and sisters called to brotherhood with Christ.\\n\\nWe have seen that those who know Christ must love His brother as they have been given the ability to love and have also drank of the immeasurable love of Christ fountaining forth from upon the cross. If so, do we have a fellow believer, a true disciple of Jesus — that is, we have never forgiven? Is there one we must ask forgiveness from?\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nWhat does it mean to be “anointed by the Holy One”? It certainly sounds like a transformative experience. Simply put, a person is anointed the moment they become Christian. Verse 20 tells us that the result of being anointed is “knowledge”, and John confirms this is something Christians all have. The idea of gaining knowledge may seem vague, but it is in fact both clear and profound. It means we can only have true knowledge if we have a foundation that is rested upon truth, and there is no other truth apart from Jesus (John 14:6). In other words, the reality and the purpose of all things can only be understood through the lens of the Gospel of Christ; apart from Christ, we completely miss the bigger picture. What we can possibly know about something would be at best a sliver of its full essence. All of mankind’s greatest discoveries about our creation lead us nowhere if we have no knowledge about our Creator. \\n\\n\\nMany people associate the anointing with emotional or perhaps miraculous encounters - these moments, though wonderful, pale in comparison to this anointing of knowledge John writes about. For this is the moment where the Holy One, who is Christ, anoints us with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who is God! We become born again, with changed desires, affections, and perspectives about everything, springing forth from the life-giving Gospel. Brothers and sisters, the moment we received our anointing was the very first moment we ever thought a thought that was true! And it was the first time actual knowledge ever entered our mind! \\n\\n\\nRemember what Jesus told the Samaritan woman: “You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. The hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth” (John 4:22-23). Without Christ, there was no worshipping in the Spirit - Jews worshipped through knowing the Law and Samaritans worshipped to escape God’s wrath. Yet Jesus announced that true worship is coming and will consist of spirit and truth. The “anointing by the Holy One” is what provides us with the inseparable gift of the Spirit and the Truth so that we can finally live with affectionate God-worshipping hearts!\\n\\n\\nBecause we have the truth, we understand the danger of liars who deny the Truth. As John writes in verse 22, “Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son”. Brothers and sisters, it is a lie to claim that all religions lead to the same God. These words come from the antichrists of the world who profess truth while denying Christ. And for further emphasis, John seals his point by bluntly claiming in verse 24 that “No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also”. Now while this may seem obvious to the Christian, there are other subtle ways to deny Christ that are equally abominable and cannot be overlooked. \\n\\n\\nMany heterodox Christian views deny the hypostatic union of Christ: that He is truly God and truly man. John calls these people out to be antichrists and liars, yet many Christians today brush aside these theological discrepancies as if they are no big deal. Brothers and sisters, we must affirm the humanity of Christ because human nature, which sinned, must pay for its Sin. He lived a righteous life, obeying the Father and resisting temptation not through a spiritual nature that we did not have, but through the very same resources we have in our humanity: the Word of God, prayer, and the Spirit. As a result, Christ’s human nature and righteousness satisfies the unblemished conditions needed for our atonement. On the other hand, we must affirm Christ’s deity because only in his divine nature as God could He bear the wrath of God, which is infinite in quality, and vindicate God of all the infinite glory that was stripped away by human Sin. \\n\\n\\nSo what’s the big deal about this? So long as Christ was truly God and truly man in reality, why should we care if others profess a doctrine which is slightly wrong? To answer this, we must look at the motive behind why one would hold such a view of Christ. By denying Christ’s deity, the antichrist renders his work on the cross pointless, reducing Christ to a mere “good teacher” and claiming that Christ is someone we can live up to. By denying Christ’s humanity, the antichrist turns Him into a floating spirit which informs mankind as a divine instructor as to how humans in their own power can make themselves right with God. In both cases, these heresies are seeds that grow into cursed trees which reinterprets and adds additional teachings on to Scripture. Perhaps the most common reason for denying the true nature of Christ is that it simply does not make sense to some people. The atheist would claim this is illogical and the Jew would claim it is blasphemous. Though this may seem like an “honest mistake”, behind it all is the allure to make the self, not God, the judge of what is right and wrong, what is Good and Evil. The moment the comfort of our intuition carries us away from the foundation of Scripture, we elevate our minds above our God who created it. \\n\\n\\nThis is precisely why our anointing of knowledge is so great! To the world, and in our fallen nature, placing the truth of Christ as seen through Scripture as our foundation is utter foolishness. Yet the Holy Spirit has made us realize that once we see everything through the Gospel, we truly live with clarity about everything we need to know. Are we not like the blind man, (John 9) healed by Jesus, finally opening our eyes to a world bursting with color?\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

Or will you run away thinking that you need to get to your house in time to make sure no one will steal your earthly possessions? Or perhaps will you ashamedly look back on your life of miserable delinquency that failed to recognize the obviously self-evident truth of the Gospel (Romans 1:20)?\\n\\n\\nI genuinely hope that none of you will answer in affirmation to my inquisitions. I hope, in all earnesty, that you will “not shrink from him in shame at his coming” (verse 28) — that is, that you will be among the saints who are rejoicing for the coming of the Lord, for His final act in the redemptive history. When we see His might and strength, we will not cower in dread, for that has passed away with the cross, but we will have confidence in His appearance.\\n\\n\\nYou see, by that time, if we were truly in Christ, we would have practiced righteousness because we know Him who was righteous. That is to say, not only were we imputed with righteousness that was once foreign to us, but now, in Him, we know what righteousness is. We have learned to enjoy and understand to be right what we once considered to be of opposition to us. We once hated the righteousness that was Christ, but in regeneration and redemption, we enjoy all that is Christ and hence enjoy righteousness. This is why we can practice righteousness that John so emphasizes in verse 29.\\n\\n\\nJohn is saying that those who practice righteousness are showing the obvious signs that they are reborn, and we who can identify it also have assurance because before our regeneration (that is, being born again), we would not have been able to identify it as “righteous”.\\n\\n\\nIn this, us, “little children”, have the assurance of looking up to the Father with a smile and confidence that no other people in the world could claim. We are a people who look forward to the Second Coming because not only will we be resurrected, but we will join the King in His exaltation.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to this assurance, however, we also feel in our passage today a prodding of a commission to go forth and live out what we have been born into.\\n\\n\\nIf we have been “anointed” (verse 27), as we read yesterday, then we have to understand that there is a special calling to ministry tied to it. David was called to kingship that was destined to lead to the living out of a priestly kingship that foreshadowed the Priestly Kingship of Jesus. If we are called into that royal family along with David and especially with Jesus, the Lord of All, we are to live out that royal calling.\\n\\n\\nThe royal line of kings do not choose for themselves a life that they desire. They cannot just pack up and leave their royal duties that they have been born into. (Let us ignore the British monarchy and the current events surrounding Prince Harry’s forgoing of the throne as the current monarchy is a pretense of a real royal priesthood as seen in the Bible). For us, if we have been born into the royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9), we live out that life. Because we are other-worldly creatures of the Royal Priesthood to God, we must live out that identity.\\n\\n\\nForemostly, we see this living out to be to recognize Jesus’s righteousness and to practice righteousness. It is a process of firstly knowing Christ, and then of imitating Christ.\\n\\n\\nAre we proud of our identity? Are we confident of our status?\\n\\n\\nIf so, we will live out that identity, and we will await, with assurance and anticipation, the coming of our Lord and the glorification of our status before the Lord.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

Perhaps we notice movements that are clearly heretical and assure ourselves that we have no part in them. But brothers and sisters, is that not how all professing Christians think? Surely there was a time in the past where your perspective towards the Lord was unbiblical or unrepresentative of His character. Yet by grace, the Holy Spirit faithfully corrected you and taught you more about the true person of Christ. Let us recognize this and praise God! And let us not assume that our view of God is without fault. We must turn towards prayer and our foundation of Scripture alone, continuing to work out our salvation with fear and trembling (Phil. 2:12). We must humbly recognize how susceptible we are to eisegesis, which is to reinterpret the Bible with our own presuppositions. Pray earnestly that the Holy Spirit would cut away the lurking, self-interpreting, urges behind every verse that you read! In order for this to happen, we must listen to what John commands in verse 24: “Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you.” \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, are we aware about what the antichrists do? John writes this warning because it is common for antichrists, and for ourselves, to add on to Scripture. They may claim to have received special revelation from the Holy Spirit. John makes it clear that what we hold on to must be what we have heard from the beginning. This refers to the teachings of the apostles. Remember that John is writing “no new commandment, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning, the word which you have heard” (1 John 2:7). \\n\\n\\nClever antichrists can easily fool the Christian who does not have Scripture dwelling richly in his heart. They can take any verse in the Bible and tie it back to their own constructed theology. Or perhaps, they may seem unsuspicious on the surface as they underemphasize certain details and overemphasize others. They may even have their own explanation about who the antichrists are in 1 John 2! Consider how cult leader Sun Myung Moon falsely justifies that Jesus did not come to die:\\n\\n \\n\\nPeople may now ask, \\"What about the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning the death of Jesus on the cross?\\" We must know that there are dual lines of prophecy in the Bible. One group prophesies Jesus\' rejection and death; the others, such as Isaiah, Chapters 9, 11, and 60 prophesy the glorious ministry of Jesus when the people accepted him as the Son of God. Why then did God prophecy in two contradictory ways in the Bible? God did not know how the people would respond to His providence for the Messiah. He had no choice but to predict two contradictory results—dual prophecies, each possibility depending on human actions. We find in the Bible a dual prophecy concerning the coming of the Lord of the Second Advent. Revelation 1:7 definitely prophesied the arrival of the Lord with the clouds. However, 1 Thessalonians 5:2 states: \\"For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.\\"\\n\\nNow to us, we may laugh and think that this is obviously wrong - some of us could quickly refute this argument. But what about interpretations that are much more subtle or concepts we are less familiar with? We often tell ourselves “test everything with Scripture”, but how often do we do it? When you read Dinky Daily Devotionals, do you assume whatever we say about the Bible without a second thought? Do you read “Please do not blindly accept our Word as true” and assume that our cautiousness implies our correctness? \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us not protest that examining and testing everything with Scripture is impossible or unimportant. Certainly it is impossible by flesh alone, but consider the Person and Work of the Holy Spirit. Make no mistake, there is one true way to view Scripture. It is through the ministry of the Holy Spirit that this true Gospel abides in us (verse 24). \\n\\n\\nWhy is this important? John explains in the second half of the verse that “if what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father”. Thus, it is not without reason that we make sure what we were given from the beginning remains untainted; it is the very condition for abiding with the Son and the Father!\\n\\n\\nWhat does abiding mean? The word “abide” is mentioned 12 times in John 15 where Jesus declares himself to be the True Vine and us to be His branches. In this case, we see that we abide in the Son, through whom we have life, and abide in the Father, our Vinedresser who knows how to make us bear fruit. And the true Word, what we have “heard from the beginning”, is what flows between the vine and the branch, Christ and us. As Pastor John Piper puts it, “We are being cared for both internally by Christ’s life coursing into us by the Spirit and externally by the providences of a loving Father who knows how to discipline his children.”\\n\\n\\nIs it not amazing that abiding in the Word brings us into such an ecosystem of life? After all, as John writes in verse 25, “And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life”! For the very idea of God abiding in us, and us in Him, is what true life is. Moreover, the very meaning of the word “abide” is to remain fixed. Thus, as Christians, we have this true life forever (John 10:28-29)! Eternal life is not a vacation home in the clouds that we enter into after death, but eternal life is what we have already the moment we are grafted into Christ, the Tree of Life. Brothers and sisters, let us hold on unwaveringly to the Word we began with, for with it, we abide in our Lord with life!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. How has the Holy Spirit changed and corrected your view of Scripture over the years? \\n\\n2. Do you see how a truer understanding of the Word brings more life into your walk with Christ?\\n\\n3.

But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the “anointing”, we know that John is talking about the receiving of the Holy Spirit. This is the same image as that which is alluded to in 1 Samuel 16 when David is anointed king and the Holy Spirit rushes upon him. David was anointed by Samuel with oil and then in a rush as if a wind not unlike that of Acts 2, the Holy Spirit descended upon David to remain with him in perpetuity.\\n\\n\\nThis Spirit given to the greatest king of Israel is the same Spirit that lives inside all who call upon the name of Jesus as King of their hearts. This same Spirit that taught David the myriad of poetry and songs is the same Spirit that makes us to sing hymns of praise. Finally, as John points out in today’s passage, this same Spirit of God speaks and teaches the believers “about everything” that they should know to “abide in him” (verse 27).\\n\\n\\nNow, before going any further, we must be assured that John is not making a case against teachers in general. For as we have studied in Ephesians, teachers are one of the gifts of God to men (Ephesians 4:11). We must not mistakenly conclude from this passage that we are to rid ourselves of all human teachers to be reliant only on the Spirit to reveal and to expound the Scripture in all its magnificence and coherence.\\n\\n\\nNo, rather, John is meaning to say that there is no additional knowledge or special teaching that is needed for the Church to understand Scripture — we are sufficiently adorned with the revelatory scope of the Spirit to understand the Word that is made clear to us. We understand without a special knowledge what God’s Good News is if we have the Spirit within us. Again, John is not saying that the support systems God instituted in the form of pastors, teachers, and fellow brethren are not important, but that they are additional assistance to what is the sufficient working of the Spirit. To forget that the Spirit works in these fellow believers to evoke metamorphosis within us would be foolishness.\\n\\n\\nInstead of making such general statements such as, “I only need the Holy Spirit to exposit Scripture. To use other aids is heretical according to this letter!”, we need to read these verses in context!\\n\\n\\nWhat has John been protecting the faith of the recipients of this letter from? The antichrists — those who are denying the orthodox incarnation of Christ. We learned earlier that these people would come to be called the “docetists” or in general, “gnostics”. They believed that a special knowledge and revelation was to be received by believers if they were to “follow God properly”. To this, John is responding, “Rubbish!”. The Christian has already received the sufficiency of divine indwelling. They do not need some special knowledge that the man must procure and comprehend within the confines of the limited human mind, but the believer, rather, is in communion and in perfect communication with God who is omniscient. Once again, as in the Garden, man receives all he needs from God directly.\\n\\n\\nJohn wants to protect the believers from evil men who are “trying to deceive” them (verse 26). To protect ourselves from such deception, we must first realize that the anointing abides in us, that we have no need apart from God to abide in Him, and that all we receive from Him is true (verse 27).\\n\\n\\nIn these troubling times, the antichrists will attack. There are plenty of evil men out there who are seeking to take advantage of people troubled by the circumstances of this world. They peddle their “methods” for procuring the “prosperity” of God. I received such a postcard in the mail today! Some even use the events to push for a reform of the kingdom of this earth while never once having had the heart to serve the Kingdom of God.\\n\\n\\nThe devil will take advantage of troubles to make us to focus on the troubles in and of themselves so as to shift our gaze away from heaven down to earth. This may come in the form of prosperity gospel, and it may come in the form of enticing the believers to be angry about the injustices committed against men while making us to not even notice the evil committed towards God in our acts of disdainful worship.\\n\\n\\nIt is at this time that we must rely on the Spirit to teach us what to do rather than what the popular causes of the world allure us to.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1.

Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. 8 Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nWhat does your struggle against sin look like? \\n\\n\\nOftentimes, we can find ourselves apathetic to sin⁠—we live day to day and do not think much of our “little” sins as long as we do not commit the “big sins.” We can also find ourselves discouraged in our struggle against sin. We have tried again and again to overcome certain sins, but to no avail. As a result, we give in to these sins without much hope or desire to change. \\n\\n\\nIn today’s passage, John makes it clear what our relationship to sin must be now that we are followers of Christ: we are to reject our old sinfulness and instead live righteous lives. But how are we to do so? \\n\\n\\nFirst, our view of sin must change. John immediately tells us in verse 4 that “sin is lawlessness.” That is, sin is breaking the law. We cannot excuse sin as simply a harmless mistake that we make, but instead we must view it as a terrible transgression against the law and against the Lawgiver. Just as we cry out against injustice when there is someone who is not punished for their crimes, we must have the same harshness against ourselves whenever we sin. Sin mustn’t be taken lightly. \\n\\n\\nFurthermore, all sin is lawlessness. We cannot let our own moral compass override what the Bible teaches about sin, and in doing so categorize “major” sins and “insignificant” sins. Oftentimes, we overlook the sins we commit when we speak harshly to others or think ill of another person. Whatever these “insignificant” sins may be in our own lives, let us cling to the Biblical view of sin that denounces any sin as a transgression of God’s law. \\n\\n\\nWhat does all this mean for us now? We are to take a stand against sin and “practice righteousness” (verses 7-8). In verse 6, John warns that “no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.” What John is talking about here is ongoing sin. That is, those that are now in Christ are now to struggle against sin and flee from it rather than living in sin with no desire to change. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, we are to hate, loathe, and struggle against sin. This does not mean that we do not sin completely, but rather that we are continually confessing our sins, continually being sanctified, and continually striving for holiness. That is how we must now live as followers of Christ. \\n\\n\\nIn order to understand this better, imagine that a bird lands on top of your head. You are not responsible for the bird landing on your head, but you are certainly responsible if you stand still and let the bird make a nest in your head. In the same manner, brothers and sisters, we will face temptation, but we must struggle against it and flee from it, lest it settle in our hearts and become sin (James 1:15). \\n\\n\\nBut how are we to do all of this? John tells us in verse 8 that Jesus has come to destroy the works of the devil. That is, Jesus has come to destroy the consequences of sin, and He already has for all those that believe in Him. Jesus has come to destroy the power of sin, and we see that currently working in the lives of believers. Jesus has come to destroy sin once and for all, and we will see that when He makes His triumphant return. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, Christianity is not some kind of moral workout where we train to become better people. We do not struggle against sin by simply waking up one day and deciding that we will sin no longer. Rather, we are to abide in God and know that because of His work, we are no longer bound to sin.\\n\\n\\nWhenever we are discouraged in our struggle against sin, let us look once again to the cross, where Jesus defeated sin on our behalf. Let us reject the lie that we cannot overcome our sins, for Christ has already overcome them and His Spirit is working in us. Let us remember and declare this morning that Jesus has destroyed the power of sin, and let us sin no longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What does your struggle against sin look like? \\n\\n2.

We are known by our fruit. \\n\\n \\n\\nChristianity is not a skill to be learned or a switch that we flip on when we are at church or with other Christians. It is a change in our nature, the essence of who we are. As 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, anyone who is in Christ is a “new creation”.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThat is what John is talking about here when he says that believers are “born of God” and that His seed abides in us. We are no longer “children of the devil” who only knew sin and were in love with it. Rather, our entire being is changed to love God and serve Him rather than to “keep on sinning” (verse 9). And as God’s seed abides in us, we grow in our love and service to Him, and we grow in our hatred and contempt for the sin that we once loved. \\n\\n \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let this not simply be rhetoric that we read and understand in our minds but has no impact on our hearts and our lives. Rather, let us carefully examine our lives and be very honest with ourselves and before God. We either “practice righteousness” and “love [our] brothers” (verse 10) or we do not. Likewise, we are either “children of God” or “children of the devil.” \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat does this mean for us? For true believers that are slipping away from the pursuit of God, let this passage serve as a sober reminder that we are not to love “in word or talk but in deed and in truth” (1 John 3:18). Furthermore, when we are tempted, let us cling to this passage to stand firm and declare that we are no longer children of the devil who go about sinning, but we are children of God that “practice righteousness” instead. \\n\\n \\n\\nFor those that read this passage and realize that they do not have a true knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ because of the fruit they bear, stop wearying in the guilt and vanity of sin, and instead come before the Lord this morning in surrender.

And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother\'s righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n \\n\\nAs Christians, what John writes in verse 11 goes without saying: we should love one another! This love that we have is the very Love “that we have heard from the beginning”, the Gospel message given by the apostles. We must never taint the perfect Love of God by separating the two. Our Love is defined by the Gospel; if we instead take our own understanding of love and twist the Gospel message around it, we become like the antichrists, who miss the joy of knowing the Love of God altogether. For the true Love of God is powerful, and its fruit testifies to the glory of Christ. Remember Jesus said that “by this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35). Brothers and sisters, let us not assume that we are loving if we merely refrain from hate. Love is active - it should shine forth from us so that the world can see the character of Christ displayed in His Body of believers. Let us take initiative! Let us love, even if we do not feel like it in the moment, for the Love that we have received is unconditional. \\n\\nWhen we act out this Love, something we should expect is hate from the world. After all, the foundation of our belief is completely different from what the world believes. This is why Jesus tells us in verse 13 “Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you”. Although a hateful response from the world is the norm, we must not actively fish for this hate! We must pray for the wisdom to discern how to balance between our compassion for the world and our commitment to an undiluted Gospel truth. Nonetheless, we will be hated because the true Gospel is offensive to an unrighteous world. But at the same time, the hate we receive will partly be because of our own mistakes. In many cases, because of our sin, we will have a degree of ignorance and self-righteousness even if we are well-intentioned. We must not be self-righteous, for we are saved by grace alone, but at the same time, we cannot let the accusations of the world defeat us, for once again, we are saved by grace alone. Let us learn wisdom from our mistakes and continue to make every effort to proclaim the Gospel as we look to Christ!  \\n\\nIn order to illustrate the reality of the world’s hate, John brings up the example of Cain and Abel in verse 12. John writes, “We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother\'s righteous.” If we look back to the protoevangelium, or the prophecy given by the LORD in Genesis 3:15, we realize that because of sin there will exist an enmity between the offspring of the serpent and the offspring of the woman. How can the serpent have offspring? John explains here that Cain was “of the evil one”. In other words, Cain was the spiritual offspring of the serpent. Immediately after the protoevangelium, we see the prophecy unfold as Cain murders Abel, leaving his blood crying out from the ground to the Lord (Gen. 3:10). This wretched incident paints a picture of hopelessness, as if the serpent crushes the offspring of Eve. \\n\\nYet for Christians, though we may face the crushing blows of the world, we can look to Christ, our blessed hope (Titus 2:13)! Abel may have been crushed, but Eve conceived of Seth and said, “God has appointed for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him” (Gen. 4:25). Through this line of Seth came Christ, the “offspring” who decisively defeated the serpent and his offspring. Furthermore, Hebrews says that the blood of Christ “speaks a better word than the blood of Abel” (Heb. 12:24). While Abel’s blood condemned Cain, Christ blood, when sprinkled on us, advocates for us because of His righteousness. Because of Christ, our love is victorious against anything the offspring of the serpent may scheme of in this final hour. \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, walk in love! Do not be like Cain, who caused evil to multiply, but be instead like Christ, who is the blessing that multiplies throughout the Earth!\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. What are some ways you can love your brothers and sisters in Christ? What are some ways you can love the world that does not yet know Him?\\n2. Has your walk of love been met with hate?

The love here, within the context, is specifically the saving love of God (God’s love of complacency). This is the unconditional love of God that is given to us “even when we were dead in our trespasses” (verse 5).\\n\\nIn this mercy, God “made us alive together with Christ” in His mercy when God “raised us up with him” (verse 5, 6). Through the death of Christ, we died with Him (2 Corinthians 5:14-15) and became dead to sin (Romans 6:10-11) in Him, and by death to sin, from our death in sin, we have been raised up with Christ.\\n\\nThis is grace — that we who did not deserve any reward (but rather deserved punishment!) received resurrection from the dead to be seated with God “in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (verse 6). What a scandalous idea! Not only are we delivered from our punishment, but we are glorified as to be seated with Christ — that is, “at the right hand of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2).\\n\\nWhy did God do any of this? We’ve already covered that God saves us in mercy which is abundant because of His love, through the grace of Christ, but all for what?\\n\\nIt is quite simply to show the “immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus” (verse 7). In an almost circular fashion, God saved us by grace to show that He is a gracious God. God, in His actions, reflects His very character because that is who He is. God does not commit acts of grace because He has to fit a certain standard, but He does so because in His very nature, He is the epitome of the fullness of grace. Therefore, because He is the epitome of the fullness of grace, God subjects Himself in flesh to the world so that we may receive grace upon (or through) grace (John 1:16).\\n\\nGod, in His kindness, showed the “immeasurable riches of his grace” by showing Himself and raising us to Himself.\\n\\nWhat good news that is. Not only that we were delivered from the state of destruction we were in, but that we are seated with the Son of God Himself. For us who have this assurance and the hope thereof, can rest soundly knowing that God is with us and that one day we will see Him in a new body. This is why despite what condition we may be in, we can “hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.” (Hebrews 10:23).\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

As David proclaims in Psalms 8, “When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him.” It really is mind-boggling that God who is Holy, Righteous, and Almighty would care for His creation. Now John leading up to and at the start of Chapter 3 emphasizes the significance of the love God has given specifically to His children.\\n\\nIt is imperative we understand that not everyone is a child of God and thus not everyone is loved in this manner by God. John makes this clear when referring to “us”, the ones who the Father has given His love to, as “children of God” in the first verse. Additionally, John 1:12 clarifies that the children of God will not be everyone but those who receive and believe in His name, “But to all who did receive him, who believed in His name, he gave the right to become children of God.” This love, as mentioned at the very start of verse 1, was given to, or bestowed on, us. Hence His love is not something we worked hard to get and can be prideful about but rather a gift to magnify His Grace. John takes a second to be enamored with the magnificence of God’s love since it truly is breathtaking and worthy of emphasis. I think it would be fruitful if we did the same.\\n\\nNow the kicker is in the second part of verse 1: “The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.” This isn’t the first time John alludes to the motif that being both of the world and rooted in Christ is not compatible. In the previous chapter he emphasizes that we should “not love the world or the things in the world” since if you do, “the love of the Father is not in him.” (1 John 2:15). John makes clear why the world does not know us, “[the world] did not know him.”  Conceived in iniquity, the hearts of man oppose God and seek what is sinful as a result of original sin. However, through Christ alone we die to our old self and are regenerated, conforming to the image of Christ. Although we still succumb to sin, by sanctification we start loving what He loves and hating what He hates. This is not a change of attitude or lifestyle but a complete change of heart which marks a distinction between those who have truly been regenerated through Him and those who have only changed superficially.\\n\\nUnfortunately, evangelical churches today focus more on giving a message about how much one can be like the world while still being a “Christian” since they are worried that sermons proclaiming our need for God and our inability to do anything with our own strength will be poorly received. Hence the gospel message is often twisted or watered-down to undermine and even affirm the sinful, enjoyable ways of the congregation in order to tickle their ears, using Jesus as a means to temporarily fix these issues. (2 Timothy 4:3)\\n\\nI pray that the evangelical church will be cleansed of this unbiblical, pragmatic approach. As John emphasizes time and time again, there is a major difference between the world and those who abide in Him. As Jesus elaborates in John 15:18-19, “‘If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.’” \\n\\nWhat we need is not a message that caters to the contemporary carnal heart which says you can call yourself a Christian and continue to live like the world, having sex outside of marriage, but a message that emphasizes how, as John mentioned in 1 John 1:6, regardless of your claim to abide in Him, if you walk in darkness the truth is not in you. The focus should not be on trying to make Christianity more likable for the world but on how much the world needs Christ. All that a Carnal Christian message does is create falsely assured Christians who think that the prayer they once prayed a long time ago to let Jesus come into their hearts or the time they got on their knees filled with emotion while singing a worship song is sufficient to be a Christian. This isn’t loving at all. This is blasphemy that leads to people falling away from the faith once they go to college or don’t find the flashy worship services entertaining anymore. Let us not conform to the world but acknowledge, as John mentions, why the world will not know us.\\n\\nBeing children of God does not mean that on this earth we will experience wealth or good health. It does not even mean that God has a “wonderful” plan for our lives in terms of worldly standards. God’s “wonderful” plan for Stephen was for him to be stoned and for Peter it was for him to be crucified upside down. The main point I am trying to get across is that we should not conflate being a child of God with worldly prosperity. The greatest gift is that, as John elaborates in verse 2, “when he appears we shall be like him.” However, to be like Him does not mean that we will be identical to Christ and omniscient or omnipotent but rather without sin and without any imperfections. So when the world persecutes you for abiding in Him and upholding the truth, have assurance that “what we will be has not yet appeared” for we know that in Him we will have a much sweeter gift for all eternity: being with Him in perfect quality. \\n\\nFinally in veres 3, John delivers a simple yet encouraging message: “everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.” Since we know our eternal destiny from the promise mentioned in verse 2, John exhorts us to live with an ultimate hope solely in Him. With childlike admiration and reverence of God’s love for us, let us all continue to live our lives more like Jesus, conforming to his image in anticipation for the moment we will be with Him.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. How has the gracious gift of God’s love been manifested in your life?\\n\\n2. How does the eternal assurance that John presents for those who abide in Him affect your actions in the present?\\n\\n3.

Whoever does not love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, are we loving each other? Our call to love cannot be overstated. Some of us may think they are loving but fail to understand what love requires. Others, in their flesh, find it difficult to love out of joy rather than duty. Let us all diligently pursue this fruit of Love, for Jesus himself said that it is the greatest commandment (Matt. 22:34-40). Although through the Holy Spirit we are inclined to love, through our flesh we will still struggle to love. After all, if Christ-like Love was an effortless endeavor, and if the Christian’s greatest commandment was easy to follow, wouldn’t the Christian life be without trials and tribulations? If Love was easy, would it really be a commandment? \\n\\nTo be clear, when we are born again, Love is not completely foreign to us. John writes in verse 14 that “We know that we have passed out of death into life”. In fact, the Holy Spirit gives us new affections so that it is our desire to love because Christ first loved us (1 John 4:19). However, there will be times where we do not feel like loving and times where our love will be mixed in with our sin. Still, though we may fail, the Holy Spirit will sanctify us as we strive towards loving our brothers. In fact, John writes in verse 14 that we can know that we are saved because we love the brothers. On the contrary, we may not be saved if we do not love our brothers because John writes “Whoever does not love abides in death”. \\n\\nWhy do we Christians love our brothers and sisters? Preacher Charles Spurgoen gives several compelling reasons we must consider. First, we love for Christ’s sake. Christ has done so much for us that we would do whatever he says because we know that He is Good. We also love for truth’s sake. Regardless of who it is, we love the Christian because of the truth he preaches and because his life story is filled with Christ. And of course, we love simply for their own sake. We stand alongside them when they are persecuted and share in their sufferings because we are all children of the same family. Let us love Christ so much that our love spills over to all who delight in Him! By the power of the Holy Spirit, let us knock down our barriers of bitterness, social anxiety, and indifference; let us imitate Paul, who is “affectionately desirous” to be in the company of his brothers and sisters (1 Thes. 2:8). \\n\\nWe must not only be filled with love, but we must also drive out hate. John makes this clear in verse 15 as he writes “Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer”. This is no exaggeration, for you have heard that Christ himself said “whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment” (Matt. 5:21-22). Brothers and sisters, do we recognize how grievously we sin when we are consumed by hateful intent? Hatred can be shown passively too! If we contemptuously ignore our brothers, have they not been murdered in our minds? Do not let hate take hold of you, for John writes “you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him”. If we abide in hate, we simply do not abide in Christ.\\n\\nAs Christians, we have passed out of death into life. We were once murderers for the sake of ourselves and are now being murdered for the sake of Christ. When John writes “because we love the brothers”, he uses the word apage for love - we are to love our brothers with the very love Christ had for us. This echoes the new commandment Jesus gave us: “just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another” (John 13:34). When we consider the body of Christ broken for us and the blood of Christ spilled for us, let us remember that this is the very agape-love we are called to share with our brothers.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Have you neglected the calling to love your brothers and sisters in Christ recently? I know that I certainly have.

Perhaps we think of our parents who suffered so much for us to the point of their exhaustion, and yet still made time to sit down with us and hear our problems. Maybe we are reminded of a friend who was willing to spend money and time just to share in your pain or your joy so that you may feel loved.\\n\\nThey all took something from themselves, whether that was time or resources, and decided to use it for your benefit— without thinking about how it would benefit them.\\n\\nWell, as Christians, we all know the greatest love we could have ever known. God decided to enter His creation to unite His deity with the humble human flesh to not only live a perfect life, but to die for us (Philippians 2:5-8). “By this we know love” (verse 16).\\n\\nKnowing such magnanimous love of God frees us from the bondage of sin to love as Christ loved us. “We ought to lay down our lives for the brothers” (verse 16) — that means that we should not be afraid to give it all up if it means the advancement of the Church to fulfill the Kingdom call we have been called to.\\n\\nJohn believes this transmission of love from the elect to their fellow members to be so critical because by it we can see whether or not an individual understands the love that has been given to him. He argues his rationale in verse 17, “if anyone has the world’s goods” — he is talking about the resources in life: time, money, shelter, etc— “and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God’s love abide in him?”. John is saying that one who has been forgiven much in God’s love ought to also love much (Luke 7:47).\\n\\nWe once did not know true love, but through Christ we have learned what that means.\\n\\nNow, if you are in a relationship with someone, is it enough to just tell them, “I love you?”once in a while, but not meet with them, share food with them, or give them help when they need it? Well, obviously not. Love requires work, and it requires commitment. As John says it here, it is something to be executed not merely “in word or talk but in deed and in truth” (verse 18).\\n\\nWait a second, why should we love our fellow church members when we were loved by God, not them? In fact, some of the church members we know are despicable! Some of them are downright rude to us and some are an annoyance. They never loved us, why should we love them? The simple answer is that they are our brothers and sisters. They have been brought to God through Christ, and we ought to remember the new relationship we have our fellow brethren. \\n\\nHowever, we have a greater reason for needing to love. It is because they are the Body. Not just any body, but the Body of the Head who is Christ. We are to treat them as if we are serving Christ. Jesus says in Matthew 25:40, “as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me”. When we look to our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, we look to them as if they have shown us the love of God that we did not deserve. We come to see the depths of love realized for us, and respond to it by loving our brothers and sisters who make up the Body of our beloved Jesus Christ.\\n\\nWe have Jesus who showed the greatest of all loves. If so, brothers and sisters, we ought to love them as Christ loved them and we ought to do it, knowing that we are doing unto Him what we do unto them.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nIn today’s passage, John gives a test for the spirits that are in our world. This is not simply something to gloss over quickly as we read because we think that it is “mystical” and doesn’t have much to do with our own lives. This passage, just like every other passage of Scripture, is “breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16-17). So what should we take away from this passage?\\n\\n\\nFirst, on a basic level of understanding, we mustn’t be so quickly amazed and convinced by spiritual displays and experiences. Similarly, we mustn’t be swayed by new doctrines and teachings on Christianity because they sound convincing enough and we like what we hear. Rather, we must test every spirit, lest we be swayed by the “spirit of the antichrist” (verse 3). \\n\\n\\nAnd John tells us how to test the spirits: by seeing if they “confess Jesus” and the truth about Him (verse 2). It does not matter how “mystical” or “spiritual” of an experience that we have. It does not matter how convincing a new teaching may seem. If those teachings and experiences do not affirm the truth about Christ as seen only in the Scriptures, they are from the antichrist. Therefore, brothers and sisters, let us vigilantly defend the truth about Christ, His teachings, and His Word.\\n\\n\\nBut if we look deeper into this passage, we can see that it applies even more directly to us. And it does so when we ask ourselves what spirit is dwelling within us. Do we have the Spirit of God within us or do we not? \\n\\n\\nAs John says, any spirit that confesses Jesus “is from God” (verse 2). But this is confusing because Jesus Himself taught that “not everyone who says to [Him} ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 7:21). And from our own experiences, we know that there are those who profess Christ and claim to know Him when their lifestyles would suggest otherwise. \\n\\n\\nThe key lies in the word “confess.” John used this word earlier when talking about confessing our sins (1 John 1:9). When using “confess”, John does not simply mean an expression of words but rather an expression of the heart. Just as we do not confess sins only with our lips but with our hearts, we confess who Jesus is with our hearts as well. \\n\\nWhat does this mean? We do not simply “admit” that Jesus is God and that He is the Messiah, but we truly believe it such that we bow down in reverence and submission before Him. Let us then ask ourselves: do we see a reverence and submission to Christ in our own lives?\\n\\n\\nThis morning, let us examine our own hearts, brothers and sisters. Let us honestly ask ourselves whether the Spirit of God dwells within us or not. In other words, let us ask ourselves if we are living a life of reverence and submission before Jesus Christ and His teachings. \\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Does the Spirit of God dwell in you? \\n2. Does the confession of your heart match the confession of your lips?

It should not be a message of continually holding yourself back from your love of everything in this world and forcing yourself to do what you do not enjoy: becoming closer to God. For as 1 John and the rest of scripture clearly states, if you are truly regenerated in Him, your enjoyment in the ways of this world will start to fade and be replaced with a passion to be more like Christ. As the famous hymn goes, “Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.”\\n\\nThe primary message, that rightfully must be reiterated, John is giving to Christians is to conform to the image of Christ. Now his focus specifically from Chapter 2 verse 28 to the end of Chapter 3 is the children of God, providing both assurance and clear distinctions of true children. At the start of this passage in verse 11, we see the fruit true children will bear if God’s gracious love is manifested in us. Just as Jesus lived the most selfless life, we should do the same.\\n\\nGiven the manifestation of God’s love for us and the regeneration of our hearts, John gives both a word of exhortation and encouragement in the four verses starting from 19. As my brother Handa elaborated in yesterday’s devo on verse 19 and 20, even with a solemn brokenness over our sins, we do not need to fear as “God is greater than our heart.” It is by his power and his strength that even when “our heart condemns us,” we can find peace in knowing God’s provision for his children. \\n\\nGetting to John’s encouragement starting from verse 21, we now see the benefits of being a true child of God. To clarify, when John says “if our heart does not condemn us,” he does not mean our heart not condemning us equates to being sinless. As fallen creatures, it is inevitable that we will still succumb to sin even after being regenerated in Christ. This encouragement is specifically for the plausible instance when we uphold righteousness as a result of Christ in us even though we are sinful creatures. So in this case John means a regenerated heart which sincerely acknowledges our situation not a degenerate heart which is ignorant to the truth and engulfed in pride because the latter will not condemn us regardless. Now given the circumstances that our regenerated heart does not condemn us, “we have confidence before God.” \\n\\nTo further understand this confidence, let us look at verse 22, “and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.” The encouragement John provides for Christians with a regenerated heart is pretty amazing. John asserts that we can have confidence in asking God for things. However, this is where it gets sticky and dangerous if taken out of context. \\n\\nMany may say that the verse clearly says “whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him ” so regardless, it should mean that if I keep his commandments and please him, asking for whatever I want whether it is a nice car or a big house should always be answered. Which I respond with a warning that you are practicing very dangerous eisegesis. First and foremost, John is not giving a good faith leads to answered prayers message. Hence we cannot draw the conclusion that obedience will cause or directly lead to God answering whatever we ask of him. This is why John constantly emphasizes conforming to the image of Christ and always checking ourselves to see if we truly walk in light or in darkness. It is through this detail we can understand the bigger picture. \\n\\nIf we walk in the light and conform to the image of Christ, His desires naturally become our desires and His will coincides with our will. This is why John states that “whatever we ask we receive from him” because with a heart that yearns to be like Christ, what we ask of him will be answered since it is what God wants. Keeping his commandments and doing what pleases Him isn’t something that leads to answered prayers but rather a natural result of our faith if we have been regenerated in him. Let us make sure that our heart is not set on our own desires but rather God’s.\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Have you ever felt overwhelmed by sin in your life?\\n2.

We know so by our actions toward the fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. If we are imitating the love that has been shown us by Christ, we can be reassured in our hearts that we are before God presented with a righteousness not our own.\\n\\nThis passage is so comforting because it says that even when our own hearts condemn us and make us to question whether or not we are in Christ or not, we have the assurance of our faith in the God who is “greater than our heart” — that is, even the heart that we cannot seem to sometimes control or manage is not far from God’s hands. We know the God who has rescued us by His power in the greatest love we could imagine.\\n\\nWe see that John is following a chain of reasoning continuing from yesterday’s passage. Yesterday we saw that since Jesus loved us, we ought to love our brothers and sisters. From there, John goes on to say, by seeing that our brothers and sisters love us, and by showing our love to our brothers and sisters in Christ, we can understand that we have a right standing before God. Even when it seems impossible to believe that God would somehow love a sinner like us, we have the confidence that God loves us through the more perceptible, physical Body of Christ that we see as the Church.\\n\\nIt is to say that when we feel like we cannot stand before God because of the weight and pain of our sins, we can look to the Church who will show us a glimpse of what it will be like to enjoy God in perfect fellowship with Christ and the Church. It is our best method of bringing heaven to earth. This is what we pray when we ask God in the Lord’s prayer, “let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” — by loving the Church, we share the truth of the Gospel in salvation amongst each other. We need the Gospel not only when we are first saved, but every single day in our walk with God.\\n\\nIf the Church is the evidence of Christ’s love for us, we must understand the implications of such imperative upon our lives. Our call to love our brothers even extends to our confidence to stand before the Lord in our daily lives. It means that when we feel sinful and dry in our faith, we have a shoulder on the Body of Christ to lean on, and when others in the Body are struggling, we can also be that shoulder.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful and beautiful opportunity to be a light to our fellow brothers and sisters. When the Church is suffering, we can share in the pains and we can love as Christ loved us. When we feel like we cannot feel Christ’s love, we rely on the Church to help us to remember it, and when a fellow believer is struggling to believe it, we can be there to remind them through our actions of love and kind sacrifice.\\n\\nGod truly is greater than our hearts. Even when we cannot hold on with our own hearts to the assurance of the salvation we have received, by the Church we are shown our dependence on God. Through the Church and our falling back on the Church, we are reminded in analogy that when we do not have the assurance and confidence, we should not rely on our own hands to try to “buy back” our salvation, but to rely on God as we rely on the Church. The Church helps us to stay true in our belief that we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone by being there to remind us that it is not our own power that saves but our reliance on God that does. \\n\\nIf so, let us be there for the believers when they are struggling.

In today’s passage, John tells us what that singular commandment is: “believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another” (verse 23). \\n\\nThe first thing to note is that this is a singular commandment. That is, we cannot have one without the other. When we truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and His great demonstration of love for us (Romans 5:8), we naturally overflow in love towards others. \\n\\nFurthermore, this is the singular commandment. It is the summary and crux of what we are to do as followers of Christ. Jesus Himself says in Matthew 22:34-40 that the “great commandment in the Law” is to “love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your mind” and to “love your neighbor as yourself.” \\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us meditate on this singular commandment this morning, for from this commandment all of our actions and thoughts flow. Do we truly “believe in the name of his son Jesus Christ” (verse 23)? To believe in the name of Jesus is more than to believe that He existed, or to have some kind of intellectual knowledge about Jesus. Rather, to believe in the name of Jesus is to trust in Him alone for our salvation and hope, and to submit to Him as Lord over our lives. It is to depend upon Jesus daily, knowing that we are nothing without Him and what He has done for us. \\n\\nTherefore, let us ask ourselves again, brothers and sisters: do we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ? \\n\\nFurthermore, do we love one another? Do we love one another not just with lip service and the words that we say, but “in deed and in truth” (1 John 3:18)? Do we love one another not because of what others may offer or because they love us first, but rather because we know and trust that Jesus loved us first (John 13:34)? Do we love one another in the same sacrificial way that Jesus loved us (John 15:13), or do we only love each other when it is convenient for ourselves?\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, this is at the center of our faith. We can be filled with great knowledge about the Scriptures, we can faithfully serve those around us, we can stand against the sins of racism and injustice that we see around us, but this is all meaningless if we do not believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and love others. \\n\\nThis morning, let us return to the simplicity of knowing Jesus and His great love for us and for others. Let us clear the stage in our hearts of all other clutter and noise, and let us come to know the Lord our King. \\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. Do you believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ? \\n2.

Brothers and sisters, this is by no means a trivial feat! Apart from Christ, all of creation is heavily subdued by Sin, serving it as slaves (Romans 6:16). Its constant and vicious attacks have left Man dead and depleted of all satisfaction. It has crept into the very heart of Man so that he cannot even choose to fight against the dominion of the Evil One. Yet here, John writes that He who is in us exceeds the formidable might of this world.\\n\\n\\nEach of these three verses contain three parallel statements about how it is certain that we have overcome Satan and his antichrist spirits. Verse 4 makes a claim that verses 5-6 serve to support.

This idea is emphasized again in verse 5, which begins with “they are from the world” and verse 6, which begins with “we are from God”. This distinguishing factor is what makes all the difference. Let us never forget that we have been born again and that this new birth is “not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God”. It is because of this new birth that we have gained the ability to choose the righteousness of God over Sin. Those who are “from the world” cannot even muster to lift a finger against sin because of the bondage of their will. But since we are “from God”, we now may prevail against Sin because our allegiance is to Him. Before even discussing anything about overcoming the world, John reminds us that the first step is our regeneration. \\n\\n\\nYou have overcome them - Verse 5 elaborates on what this means. These antichrists “speak from the world, and the world listens to them”. In other words, antichrist spirits say things that are alluring to the ear and nudges the world to cave into its unrighteous temptations. While we may still feel such temptations tugging at our hearts, it is sure that we have overcome them. No assault of this world will ever knock us off of His everlasting arms. This is because our ears also listen to the Word of God; John writes in verse 6 that “Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us”. Now this does not mean that we will never be deceived. After all, if that were truly the case, there would be no need for John to write such warnings to these “little children”. However, what this does suggest is that as we continue to walk with Christ, we will slowly overcome all deception and abide wholly by his Word.\\n\\n\\nHe who is in you is greater than he who is in the world - This powerful truth should fuel us with much confidence! Let us never forget that within us is the sovereign indwelling of the Holy Spirit. There is nothing greater than God, and so there is nothing greater than He who is abiding in us Christians. Verse 6 ends by stating “by this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error”. Those whose hearts yearn to listen to the Word have the Spirit of truth, and this Spirit of truth demolishes any spirit of error that might dare come against it. Even if Satan decided to channel every ounce of his might against us, it would be, as evangelist Paul Washer puts it, like an imperceptible flea trying to topple a concrete wall.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, take heed to these encouragements! John does not write these things for no reason. He has written again and again that we would be hated by the world and that we are called to love when loving is difficult. Let us remember these verses so that we can fight on with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. \\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What spiritual battles have you been fighting? \\n2.

And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nWe talk about faith a lot in Christianity. Yet, when a Christian thinks of faith, and when someone asks “how is your faith?”, the Christian might instinctively just say something along the lines of: “It’s been good. I have been reading my Bible, praying a lot, etc…”. At times, faith for the Christian might become just a laundry list of spiritual practices he/she might have been able to do in the past week. Yet, this is not the way the Bible describes faith, and not the way Paul describes faith here in this passage.\\n\\nFor faith, as seen in verse 8, is the means by which we are saved, and the means by which continue in our race (Colossians 1:23).\\n\\nSaving faith, as we know it, is not merely an intellectual consent (a head knowledge) to the elements and narrative of the Gospel, but a full assent of the heart, the soul, the mind, and as a result the body to the works of Christ that have secured our salvation. Those who read the devotional for Ephesians 1 - 3 should now realize something is very problematic about this statement. We learned that we were dead in our sins and therefore hated all things God — how can we assent to something we despise?\\n\\nIt is possible because even faith in itself is the grace (undeserved gift) of God presented to us through Jesus Christ that we have not worked toward or achieved (verse 8). What that means is that even our faith to believe in the works of Christ has not come from ourselves but it is born from the regeneration (a fundamental transformation of our being) that God gifts us with in our baptism of water and Spirit (John 3:1-8).\\n\\nFaith is not something that we have arrived at through our understanding, nor is it the result of a certain amount of Herculean work that we have completed. Rather, we cannot boast about our faith because it is something given to us freely (verse 9). If we were to boast about our faith, it would only be of the giver of the gift of faith, namely Christ Himself who authored it.\\n\\nHowever, this does not mean that we are not to do any good works. No, contrarily, Paul states in verse 10 that we are “created in Christ Jesus for good works”. Yet, this is wrapped around the statement: “we are his workmanship [...] which God prepared beforehand” to show that God is the one who prepares us through His work (workmanship) in both the creation and in the work of the cross. We have faith in the God who created us, saved us, and lives in us to have prepared us for all the good works that we are meant to do. Not only can we do good works (different from whence we could not), but we are created to do good works.\\n\\nSo, how can we answer the question, “how is your faith?” It’s not necessarily wrong to answer with what kinds of spiritual practices you have been practicing. However, if you end it with just that, you may not have fully understood the question. Rather, we should wonder about why and how that spiritual practice has influenced our hope and faith thereof (or how we are struggling through it).\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.

He explains that “if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another” (verse 11)— in this verse, he presents it as an imperative, as a normative command that a Christian ought to perform. Then, in the next verse, he presents the love shown in us as the sign that “God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.” (verse 12).\\n\\n\\nWhat this means is that there is both a work and a regenerative aspect to our being able to love our brothers and sisters in Christ.\\n\\n\\nThe first verse explains the “work” aspect of the love existent in Christian community. It is “work” not in the sense that it is something that we have to do unwillingly or for the sake of receiving the award or reward of justification and salvation, but it is a work that requires the human resolve and active participation in sanctification to pursue God’s kingdom in the community of believers. It is a work of obedience that we are able to do for God’s kingdom.\\n\\n\\nThe immediate response to this call for obedience could be, “if love is work, then it is not genuine — loving others must be out of an emotional outpouring.” Of course, if we believe this, we would be merely slaves to our emotions. And I do believe that we once were, however, for the Christians, those who have been freed from ourselves to be once again put under the servanthood of Christ, we have the freedom also from the bondage of acting like how we feel at a given moment. Even when we at moments do not feel like doing something, we can still choose to look to the hope of Jesus and march on in obedience through faith.\\n\\n\\nJesus, yes, even Jesus, is seen in the Garden of Gethsemane to be struggling with His human will. This is not to say that His two wills were ever against each other, but He was tempted as we were tempted to go against God’s will and to fall to how humans feel. Jesus never fell, and we also ought never fall. We ought to love when we do not want to— by looking to the Christ who loved even sinners who rebelled against Him to the point of nailing Him to the cross.\\n\\n\\nThe second of today’s verses illustrates the regenerative nature of our ability to love. We briefly touched on this above, but we were once slaves to our beings and the sin within, and could not but obey the master that is the desires of the flesh. We have since been rescued and we have been regenerated, that is, brought to life, to an ability to love once again.\\n\\n\\nYou see, love, as are all good things, is not natural to man. Love is not understood by the sinful mankind and hence, though the world knows it to be something good, they cannot define what it is to look like or even feel like. They know that it has something to do with caring for and giving to an individual other than the self, but it seems to often elevate the other person as an idol, or the feelings above God. The world substitutes proper Biblical love with the exaltation of the emotion of feeling good when being with some other person, or as the excessive desires for an individual, but we understand Biblical love to be somewhat different. Biblical love is a reflection of God’s love that we ought to show in our lives. Biblical love is a response to the love that was shown to us on the cross. We, as those who had once lost even the desire to truly love, have received the ability to love in a way that the world without God could never know. The Christians are the only people who know to love correctly.\\n\\n\\nThis does not mean that all facsimiles of love in the world are false. However, we have to remember that they are but facsimiles— just imitations of the real thing. There are acts of sacrificial love exercised by our friends and family that show us the reality of God’s love for us. These are glimpses of good things that sinful people do by the mercies of God to give the fallen world a glimpse into the vastness of His love. However, of course, the world, when enlightened by such beauties, would rather worship the gift rather than the giver, and often corrupt the gift given by God.\\n\\n\\nChristians ought not to do so. We ought to love because He first loved us. We ought to love because we are loving the Body of the Christ who loves us. We ought to love because we have been changed fundamentally to cannot but love our brothers and sisters in the faith. Though no one has seen God, by the power of God working through our love, He is seen through the Body reaching its hands out to the world.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Have we bought into the merely sensual love of the world that lacks Christ in the middle?\\n\\n2. How can we love even when our hearts deceive us? And how can we focus on God when emotions abound?\\n\\n3.

God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does abiding in God look like for us?\\n\\n\\nIn the past couple of verses, we have seen that this primarily looks like the love that exists between the members of the Christian community. I believe we have covered this explicitly and coherently throughout the past couple of weeks.\\n\\n\\nFor today’s text, assuming that we have been following the message of brotherly love that John so heavily doses us with in his healing letter, let us focus on how this love shows the salvific plan of God in sending Jesus, the Son of God, down to earth for mankind resulting in the fact that God abides in His elect and we abide in God.\\n\\n\\nThe first thing we ought to notice is that the trinity is readily present in today’s passage. This is presented to us in the light of the salvific plan for mankind: “Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the word” (verse 14) and “he has given us of his Spirit” (verse 13). It is made clear that in our abiding in God, we show God’s abiding in Himself. To allow for the Church to abide in God, all the persons of the Godhead come together in their abiding. We show our love for the Church because we know the love of God towards us, and God shows His love towards us because as verse 16 says, “God is love” and hence each person of the trinity loves each other.\\n\\n\\nNow, let us step back and take this truth one step at a time in today’s passage. In fact, we can actually go backwards. John is writing his letter from the point of needing to love the fellow brothers (as probably that was the problem at the moment) to revealing a character of God that is fundamental to the Christian faith. What John is doing is taking the Christian action of love that ought to be a fruit in our lives and backtracking to why we need to love in the character of God. For the sake of clarity, we might as well approach these verses backwards.\\n\\n\\nSo, starting with verse 16, we see that “God is love”. God is love does not mean love is God or that God is only composed of the attribute of love. Rather, it means that God is the source and the very definition of love itself. God is love because even before time began, there was a divine love between the members of the Trinity Himself. Our God, who is the God in three persons, was the only god in all the religions who can love genuinely while being completely sovereign. This love and perfect unity of the Godhead is what we call, perichoresis.\\n\\n\\nThis leads us to the next section of verse 16 to verse 15 and 14. First of all, God has love for us. God loves His creation that He need not give anything to. In fact, the creation even rebelled against the Creator and sinned against the Creator, but this God loves His elect so much to the point that the Father, the first member of the Trinity, “sent his son to be the Savior of the world” (verse 14). Not only that, but that love did not go unnoticed, but God has made it known to the world so that “Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God” would have God abide in him and him in God. We get to share in the love of God that has been retained in the Trinity even before time began.\\n\\n\\nSo, how does God abide in us? Well, that’s when the third person of the Trinity steps in. The Holy Spirit was sent. The Spirit was given to us that God actually abides in us, and as in the Spirit, we are sealed to the salvation by the work of Jesus Christ, we also abide in God as the Son of God abides with the Father and with the Spirit. In such a way, all three members of the Trinity act in love with one another to show love to us by the loving act of salvation.\\n\\n\\nFinally, how does this change us? How does this make us act? Well, that, in the end, makes us love the very brothers and sisters we have acquired as a result of the adoption to the Father through the Son, guaranteed by the Spirit.\\n\\n\\nIn such elaborate love of God to Himself, we see the amazing love God has shown us. And from there, we see the need to love our fellow Christians. Our love for each other is not borne out of mere sentimentality, but out of the desire to express the love of God. Ultimately, even our love for each other is to worship God by illuminating God’s divine attribute.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. How does the love of God within the Trinity impact our love towards each other?\\n\\n2. How can we focus on the real love we ought to practice?"},"name":"day92"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"1 John 4:17-18: Love Perfected\\n\\nJune 23, 2020\\n\\n\\n17 By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgement, because as he is so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\nWhat does the word love make you think of? Is it the feeling of appreciation and comfort among brothers or sisters in Christ? Or is it even the emotion-evoking romantic attraction to an individual of the opposite sex? While these two perceptions of love are not incorrect, the former being philia and the latter being eros, the love John is talking about in this Chapter is something different: agape or more specifically the love God has for man and man reciprocates to God.\\n\\n\\nThe message so frequent among the evangelical church today is that God loved us so much. By no means is this message wrong but when it is the only detail mentioned, it compromises the true gospel for a feel good message and actually undermines the true beauty of God’s love for us.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this uneven focus on solely God’s love leads to a dangerous and heretical understanding regarding His love towards us. If the judgement we deserve is downplayed, the message becomes that we deserve God’s love because of who we are when that is absolutely not the case. In reality, because of who we are we deserve God’s wrath but by his grace we are saved. What can be more loving than that. Now given this proper and beautiful understanding about God’s love, John focuses then on its influence on our lives as children of God. \\n\\n\\nIf we understand the splendor and magnificence of God’s love, shouldn’t it truly change us? This is primarily what the entire God’s love passage from verse 7 is about. Furthermore, when John says “we may have confidence for the day of judgement” in verse 17, he is not talking about confidence in ourselves but rather in Him who lives through us since He is the propitiation for our sins. This naturally results in His love being manifested in us. That is why the gospel message is so powerful and beautiful.\\n\\n\\nNot only is it important to realize that we do not deserve this love but also that our ability to love is because God first loved us. Hence it is not something we can brag about. To complete the entire message from verse 18, John provides encouragement in order that we do not adhere to an extreme and incorrect message. Love is not something that results out of our fear of God’s judgement but rather out of a realization that we do deserve his judgement but because of his grace, we are saved. This recognition is fundamental for a proper love of Christ and provides  clarification for those who may go overboard in focusing only on God’s wrath without his love. God’s wrath and love are codependent and work in unison to amplify his Glorious and Holy nature.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. How has God’s love been manifested in your life?\\n\\n2.

As a result, we often find ourselves trying to force ourselves to “love” more. This idea that we can grit our teeth and force ourselves to love sounds silly, and yet we so often find ourselves trying to do just that. \\n\\n\\nWe see in today’s passage that “we love because He first loved us” (verse 19). That is, we do not love out of our own determination or our own goodness. We are able to love because we have experienced this love from the Father. \\n\\n\\nAnd yet, it is so easy for us to read this verse and be unconvinced. We tell ourselves that we know the love of God and we know the Gospel, and yet it still remains so difficult for us to love God with all our heart and to love others, especially certain people. \\n\\n\\nBut if we think in this manner, we must take a closer look at the love of God that we claim to know, for it is different than the love of God that John is describing here. What is the love of God that John is describing? It is the love that loved us first.\\n\\n\\nThis is the love of God that loved us even when we did not love Him. This is the love of the Almighty One, the Holy One, the Name Above All Names that chose to love these creatures from the dirt that have the audacity to rebel against Him daily. This is the love of God that was demonstrated in Christ’s death for us while we still hated Him (Romans 5:8). \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us reflect upon the amazing and mysterious love of God once again this morning. Let us reflect upon our own sinfulness and God’s untouchable holiness, and marvel at the fact that God chose to love us despite there being nothing in us that would make us desirable. Then and only then will our hearts burn with love for God. We love because He has first loved us. \\n\\n\\nFurthermore, we cannot experience this marvelous love from the Father and be unchanged in our affections towards others. In fact, we see in verse 20 that our love for others reflects our love for God. \\n\\n\\nAnd yet, it is easy for us to conjure up excuses for not loving others. We tell ourselves that “they do not deserve it” or that “they have failed us too many times.” But brothers and sisters, is this not the very love that Christ has shown us? The very love that we now claim to know? \\n\\n\\nOr we may tell ourselves that we are simply indifferent to certain people. We have our close friends and friend groups, but we are otherwise indifferent to everyone else. But brothers and sisters, this is not the initiating love of Christ that we claim to know and cherish!\\n\\n\\nThis morning, let us examine our own relationships with others. Let us see where we fall short in loving not just those that are closest to us, but everyone around us.

And his commandments are not burdensome. 4 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nJohn begins today’s passage (verses 1-2) with a very familiar message: that those who are true believers confess that Jesus is the saving Messiah and love other brothers and sisters (verse 1). However, there is a slight twist to this familiar message on love in verse 2. Rather than stating something similar to “we know we love God when we love others,” John essentially writes that “we know we love others when we love God and obey Him.” That is, we cannot truly love others unless we love God. And we know that we cannot truly love God unless we first experience the love that He has for us. \\n\\n\\nClearly, loving God is at the heart of everything. But how do we know that we truly love God? John tells us simply in verse 3: “we keep his commandments.” However, it is not simply that we keep God’s commandments, but that we do not see them as “burdensome” (verse 3). \\n\\n\\nIn other words, a true love for God manifests itself in joyful obedience and submission before the Father. A true love for God means a heart that is ready to love others as we have been loved by God. True love for God is not accompanied with a begrudging and reluctant obedience; it is accompanied with a joyful devotion to God and His people. \\n\\n\\nThe question then becomes: how can we truly love God? John answers this question in the very next verse by stating that “everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world” (verse 4). That is, everyone who has been truly born again is no longer consumed by the desires of the world. Those who are born again are the ones that can truly love God and find joy in His commandments. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, what is our greatest desire at this very moment? Is it truly to love God and to know Him more? Is our greatest desire to devote ourselves to humble servitude before the Father? Or is our greatest desire to get married, or to have a good career, or to be back on campus? Let us carefully examine our desires, for our desires tell us who it is that we serve and love. \\n\\n\\nFinally, how is it that being born again lets us overcome the desires of this world? Because we must have faith to be born again, and it is this faith that “is the victory that has overcome the world” (verse 4). \\n\\n\\nWe may read 1 John and begin to think that everything boils down to love. We may see the commandments to love God and to love others and tunnel vision on them. However, to do so would be missing a step. We would be missing faith.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, it is faith in Jesus Christ that allows us to love Him. It is faith in Jesus Christ that allows us to overcome the world. It is faith in Jesus Christ that allows us to obey His commandments. \\n\\n\\nIt is faith that Jesus is infinitely and supremely better than anything this world has to offer that drives us to daily pick up our cross and follow Him.

Before we bury ourselves in frivolous banter between men, we must repent and look to God, who is. God is, and has always been, unchanging. His testimony for fullness of all time has been the same, singular testimony of Christ. It would take a lifetime to read about all of man’s empty testimonies while the testimony of God is revealed to us plainly if we simply look to Him. Is it not sinful that we take in the testimony of our self, or of man, as if it has authority? John writes in verse 9 that “if we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son”.\\n\\n\\nIf we are willing to trust the words of man, how much more must we cling to the Word of God? When someone believes in the Son, John writes in verse 10 that he “has the testimony in himself”. The testimony of God not only holds the absolute authority, but it also comes with absolute security. John writes here of the Holy Spirit, which serves as an inner confirmation, bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16). \\n\\n\\nFar be it from us to ever deny the testimony of God! If we are to deny God’s testimony, we place the wisdom of man above the wisdom of God. In doing so, John writes in verse 10 that we have made God a liar, “because [we have] not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son”. How ridiculous must it be for man to call his Creator a liar? It is an act of injustice to make such a claim when God has clearly revealed himself such that we are without excuse (Rom. 1:20). Even though some do not intend to call God a liar, they do it nonetheless, and it comes from a place of sin. This attitude is not just a mere misfortune, rather it is as Spurgeon writes, “an atrocious offense against the God of truth”. Those who claim they are trying to believe only magnify the offense of their words, proving that they love Sin more than they love God. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let us hold on to the testimony of God without hesitation. For the testimony is simple: John tells us in verse 11 “that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son”. Is it not crazy that our sinful hearts hack around this simple truth, trying to find fault with it? The testimony is clear and its message is urgent. It simply means that “whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life”. Let us pray that our dead and worthless world may see the immensity of the Love of God through this testimony of Christ.

We must not settle for mere affections or attractions because there exists a Love that over time can only grow deeper. Do we truly believe this? Or has our understanding of God’s Love plateaued as if we basically got the gist of it? Brothers and sisters, if it is not strikingly clear that God’s Love far exceeds anything in this world, let us consider what is written in this passage. \\n\\n\\nGod is Love - More than a physiological experience, Love is an attribute of God’s nature. John writes in verse 7 that “love is from God”. It is not a force that God has mastered, but Love itself is defined by God. Before all matter and time, God existed from everlasting to everlasting as a triune being. God was Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each Person of God had a Love for each other that was infinite in quantity and perfect in quality. God, in himself, could already experience an intense and intimate fellowship and was by no means bored when He made creation. This is why only the Christian God, who is triune, can possibly be Loving. For how could a unitary God be loving if there was no object to which this love could be expressed? After all, God cannot suddenly one day become a being with Love because God is immutable. The only explanation that makes sense is that Love had always been a part of God, expressed through His trinity. \\n\\n\\nGod sent his Son - Once we understand just how much love each Person of God had for each other, we see how crazy it is that “God sent his only Son in the world, so that we might live through him” (verse 9). Seeing a loved one be sent off is already tough to bear, even though our love for each other is imperfect. But think about how much harder it was for God, to send the Son that he so delighted in, to take on the nature of a human and be despised, mocked, and tortured to death. Yet God lavished us with his Love, and “[sent] his Son to be the propitiation for our sins” while we were his helpless and embarrassingly arrogant enemy. From the work of the Son and the willingness of Father, God shares His Love with us through the power of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n\\nJoined in his Love - By revealing this Love, God also extends it to us. As a result, God not only allows us to “live through Him”, but also brings us into the intimate dance of His trinity. We can never become God, but God has made a way, through the work of Christ, to form such a relationship with us. As we are caught up in this whirlwind of Love, we learn to delight in it so much that it extends out from our soul to others in a supernatural way. This is why John writes in verse 7 that “whoever loves [with the true Love of God] has born of God and knows God”. Afterwards, John writes in verse 8, “Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love”. John makes it clear that this Love is so magnificent that it is something you either have tasted and can attest to, or something that you simply have not yet encountered; there is no in between. \\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, God created us for this very reason, to enjoy Him as He declares who He is and expresses all His glory. By relentlessly seeking after Him, we can better know His Love to better praise His name!\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. Has your understanding of the Love of God been deepening over time or remaining stagnant?\\n2. In your life, how does this Love of God compare to the feelings of “love” in this world?"},"name":"day90"}},{"node":{"internal":{"content":"1 John 5:16-18: Sin That Leads to Death\\n\\nJune 29, 2020\\n\\n\\n16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.\\n\\n18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.\\n\\n19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\nToday, we come across one of the harder passages in the Bible. It is hard because John seems to divide sin into two different types— one leading to death and one not leading to death. Does this mean that certain sins are okay to commit? Does it mean that certain sins are unredeemable? Because John does not go into further detail about what is the “sin that leads to death”, we are left with the difficult task of gleaning from the text what this means.\\n\\n\\nFirstly, the word used for “death” in Greek is thanatos— which implies not just a physical death, but a spiritual as well. This word, though can simply mean a bodily death on earth, is often used throughout the New Testament to describe the death from sin or even the second death in Revelation. I believe that John is using the word in concordance to the other majority usages of the word— by death, we are referring to the separation from God’s goodness and love.\\n\\n\\nWith this understanding of the word for death, if we have read Romans chapter 3 or Ephesians chapter 2, we should understand that all sin ultimately leads to death. Even an ounce of sin is worthy of a death sentence as we have sinned not against mere men, but against the Almighty. If so, what does it mean when John says in verse 17, “there is sin that does not lead to death”?\\n\\n\\nWell, quite simply, there is but one way for sin to not lead to death. It is when the sin that an individual commits has proactively been accounted for. Sin is a debt to be paid, and if another has paid that debt, the sin will not lead to death, the punishment for the said debt. We, Christians, know that there is such a transaction in the substitutionary atonement of Jesus. Jesus, the only begotten Son of God, was the propitiation for our sin to pay the debt we owed— not just the sins that had been committed before, but also the sins that would come later.\\n\\n\\nI believe this is what John is referring to when he says, “there is sin that does not lead to death” (verse 17). You see, John uses the singular form of the word “sin” and distinguishes the two different types of sin— one that leads to death and one that does not. Often, in the Bible, this singular form indicates the concept and object of sin, not a specific variety of sin. And therefore, he is not categorizing a myriad of plural sins into compartments of “mortal” or “venial” sins as the Roman Catholic church would. He does not use a plural form of “sins” to show that there are certain actions of sin that are categorized as leading to death and certain actions of sin that are categorized as not leading to death. Rather, he uses the singular form of the word “sin” in order to show that these are two different results of sin that are borne, not out of the differences in the action of sin, but out of something foundational upon which the sin is committed. This makes sense as John emphasizes that “All wrongdoing is sin” to show that he is not differentiating certain actions of sin, but is trying to show that some sins that are committed upon a certain foundation do not lead to death.\\n\\n\\nThis foundation we know to be Christ. Those who truly are regenerate and are in Christ will not commit sin that leads to death because the debt has already been paid by Christ. However, for those who are not in Christ, their sin leads them to death as the justice of God requires.\\n\\n\\nNow, all of this is quite coherent until we look back at verse 16 and notice the word “his brother”. Who is a “brother”? Is not John talking about a believer then? Is he not saying that a believer can commit a sin that leads to death? This would contradict what I just explained above!\\n\\n\\nWell, something we must remember is that we do not know the salvation of an individual as that is something that happens within the being through the Spirit. Even the early Christians could not have known absolutely who truly was a believer or not. If a member confessed and was baptized, he was to be considered a “brother”.\\n\\n\\nThis is why John even wrote this letter in the first place. Many were coming to faith now, but along with the faithful were those who were coming along for a joyride. Throughout the letter John dictates signs of a true believer. John emphasized the importance of love being borne as a fruit if one truly is a believer, and here, John is showing that even in sin there is a difference between the believer and the unbeliever.\\n\\n\\nThough John is not distinguishing different sins into categories— murder and adultery in one and lying and petty theft in another, he is distinguishing that the sin committed by a believer will look different from sin committed by an unbeliever. As verse 18 shows, those born of God will not continue sinning. This does not mean that they will suddenly become perfect, but it indicates that those who love God will repent upon sinning and look to God for that salvation he has received from Christ— the sinner is considered inculpable and hence acts righteously. The believer is in the process of sanctification, and the Church must pray for him. On the other hand, those who commit sin that leads to death will keep on sinning and the evil one will touch him to continue in the world which is “in the power of the evil one” (verse 19). Though it may sound harsh, there is no need to pray for sin for those who claim to be of Christ but live a life counter to the Gospel.\\n\\n\\nJohn, as he has been doing in this whole letter, is protecting the Church against false believers and their pattern of sin that may plague the rest of the Church to fall to the powers of the world. He emphasizes the need to know who we are from and how God protects us.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, I truly hope that we would not fall to the world, but live a life free from sin. When we do fall to sin, I pray that it is sin that does not lead to death— sin that is paid for by Christ. When we do sin, I hope that we would repent and be angry as to not sin again.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1. This was a harder passage to read. Have a read again to comprehend fully.\\n\\n2.

And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nThese few verses are dense with truths that we must unpack. John is writing about three things that testify Christ: the water, the blood, and the Holy Spirit. Together, they reveal to us the glory of who Christ is through the manner in which He came. \\n\\n\\n\\nJust the fact that God came to us is ineffable. Have we forgotten how absolute God is? In the words of John Piper, everything that is not God depends totally on God. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn comparison to God, the entire universe is nothing. It came into being by God and stays in being moment by moment through God’s decision to keep it in being - it is utterly fragile and dependent! \\n\\n\\n\\nYet the Word, who is God, who is and ever will be the absolute being, came and revealed Himself to His creation. And how did He come? Did He come in full display of His Power as the Lion on Judah? No, John writes in verse 6 that the Word “is he who came by water and blood - Jesus Christ”. Christ did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, being made in likeness of men (Phil 2:6-7). God willingly became of water and of blood, loving the dust of mankind by constraining himself to flesh. \\n\\n\\n\\nBut when John writes of “water” and “blood”, it is more than just the fact that Christ was born into a body. They point to something bigger. Verses 7 and 9 show that “water” and “blood” are meant to be the testimony of the Son. When John writes of “water”, he speaks of the baptism of Christ. When John writes of “blood”, he speaks of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. These things loudly testify to us who God is by the power of the Holy Spirit. \\n\\n\\n\\nNot only do the testimony of water and blood agree, but both are absolutely necessary. This is why John specifies in verse 6 that Christ came “not by the water only but by the water and the blood”. These words stand against the false teachings of Cerinthus who, at the time, was claiming that the “spirit of Christ” descended upon Jesus at His baptism and left just before His crucifixion. Cerinthus could not conceive that such demeaning suffering would come upon Christ. But John affirms that Christ, from birth to death, was both truly God and truly man. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrother and sisters, do you understand the testimony of the water and the blood? What does the baptism and crucifixion of Christ speak of? \\n\\n\\n\\nEven John the Baptist did not think Christ should have been baptized. John was not worthy to untie His sandal, let alone baptize Him! In the Old Testament context, baptism was an act of cleansing and purification. Because the King was coming, and the people were not ready, John the Baptist had begun to call upon Jews to renew their lives through repentance and be baptized. Baptism was something that we had to do but not something that Christ had to do. Yet John writes that Christ came by water; by this he means that through baptism, Christ’s humanity was identified with our humanity. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe baptism of Christ is such an important testimony that when it happened, as divine confirmation, heaven opened and the Holy Spirit descended and rested on Christ (Matt. 3:16). We know from verse 6 that the “Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth”. Just like how the Spirit testified at the moment of Christ’s baptism, it continues to testify in agreement with the testimony of the water and blood today. Jesus himself explains that his baptism is important because it is fitting to fulfill all righteousness (Matt. 3:15). Not only did Jesus join us in the act of being baptized, but he also joined us in the responsibility of keeping the Law. Jesus, being of human nature, did not let an iota of the Law pass, thus fulfilling it on our behalf. Jesus is he who came by water, because through his humanity, he imputed his righteousness unto us. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs we also know, Jesus is he who came by blood. This is the testimony of the crucifixion, the means by which Christ justified us. The sacrificial blood of Christ is what our God of Justice required because of our grievous sins against Him. Yes, we were saved through God, but we were also saved from God. As we read in 1 John 4, the blood was the propitiation that appeased God so that we could enter into a relationship with Him. The blood of Christ is the miraculous wine that Jesus provides for His wedding with His Church (John 2). Scripture now tells us that because of the blood of Christ, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:1). \\n\\n\\n\\nJohn repeats in verses 7-8 “for there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood”. Remember that in the first chapter John wrote that he testifies to things “which we have seen with our eyes” (1 John 1:1). The water and the blood were witnessed by God’s people, confirming for us the testimony of who Christ is and what he came to do. Moreover, we have the testimony of the Holy Spirit, who through regeneration, provides us with the gift of faith, fixing our eyes upon the true and living Person of Christ. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, let the testimony of the Spirit, water, and blood minister to our hearts. For verse 8 tells us that “these three agree”. The testimony of the water is the outward cleansing and righteousness of Christ. The testimony of the blood is the human suffering of Christ that took away our Sin. Through these testimonies, we are baptized in the Holy Spirit with the “washing of regeneration” (Titus 3:5). And the testimony of the Holy Spirit is the sweetness of this water and blood. By it, we glorify God with a tune of praise ringing in our hearts!\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the water and the blood \\n\\nfrom Thy wounded side which flowed\\n\\nBe of sin the double cure \\n\\nsave from wrath and make me pure!\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\nReflect on the significance of Christ’s baptism. What does it mean to be baptized in Christ? Why do we as Christians value it so much (as opposed to Jews)?\\n\\nWhat other passages from the Word does this passage remind you of?

The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn writes to his readers of a new commandment that is at the same time an old commandment. This commandment, as we see from just a verse prior, is to “walk in the same way in which he walked” (verse 6) — to walk as Christ walked. Namely, as John further expands on this in the passages to come, this is to love the brothers, the Church, as Christ also loved the Church.\\n\\n\\nHow is the command to love the brothers an old commandment? It is old because it is “the word that you have heard” (verse 7). As all Christians have heard the word — the Gospel that shows the deepest of all loves, and the depths of the execution of such love, they have received the old commandment that they should have kept even until now. Not only that, but it is also the commandment that has been decreed even since creation. If the Christian recognizes that the belief they hold is the continuation of the covenants of love given by God since the beginning of time, then they would also understand that even before they received the Gospel, and even before Christ was glorified, God had been constructing His cogent plan of love from the beginning of time.\\n\\n\\nYet, how is it a “new commandment”? It is a new commandment because it is something to be told day after day, and practiced all the more hour after hour. It is new because “darkness is passing away” even still as it is a continuous process while the “true light is shining” (verse 8). It is a new commandment because every morning God’s mercies are new. Christ has overcome to ensure the fullness of light in the new heaven and earth to come and now the darkness will in time dissipate forever. In Christ’s love we have seen the new way of living, and hence, we will take on the new man instead of the old and remind ourselves of the commandment (Colossians 3:9-10).\\n\\n\\nIn such a way, the command that we have been given to live as Christ lived is a commandment that is old in looking back to what has already been completed on Calvary while also new in the sense that it is looking forward to live out what we have already been consummated into.\\n\\n\\nWe must understand that for the regenerate, for the saved, “the darkness is passing away” (verse 8). The fate of the sins that linger still within the cleansed sanctums of our hearts are predetermined. Though they seem to still wound us and claw at our being, those grasps and snares are but the desperate, final tremors of our old selves dying in the “true light” that already shines (verse 8). The true light shines within us, but we must not let our sinful old selves take shelter in the shadows of our being — we must let shine the light of Christ to every corner of our once dead hearts so as to allow for a sanctification that will bring healing.\\n\\n\\nThis is not a facile task. It is one filled with internal skirmishes and artillery barrages against our own evils that plague the soul. Our enemy will say, “Did God actually say you should fight so hard against something so seemingly trivial? It seems like so much loss for so little gain!” and our old selves with piqued ears will reach for the forbidden fruit. It is at this moment that we must deafen the whispers of Satan with the mighty roar of the cannons of Christ’s victory cry, “It is finished” (John 19:30). If we truly believe, and remind our renewed souls that Christ has done what we could not, we will look to Christ to say, “Help me, O Lord my God!” (Psalm 109:26-27). It is a battle, but we have the Lord who is better than any horse or chariot (Psalm 20:7).\\n\\n\\nO, may we not cover the shining light so as to entertain the shadows. May we not eclipse the foretaste of our glorification for the substandard junk food of the devil.\\n\\n\\nFor we are a shining city that cannot be covered (Matthew 5:14). May we love like Christ loved even when it means fighting against our very selves. Even when we must love those who have wronged us, let us do it knowing that Christ died for His enemies (Romans 5:10). Furthermore, even when we cannot see how our internal sin may damage the Church — a sin hidden from sight, only behind closed doors, let us remember the Church for we are one Body, and if one part of the Body suffers, even in the stillness of night, then all the Body aches.\\n\\n\\nLet us remember that our commandment is as old as our new birth and as new as tomorrow. Brothers and sisters, let us not hide in darkness that which must shine.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n\\n1. What are some sins we have had hidden?\\n\\n2.

He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.\\n\\n\\n*** Please read the verses again and try to pray through it before reading our own takes. ***\\n\\n\\n\\nAs John closes up the letter, he focuses once again on the work of Jesus Christ and His making available the truth that we as Christians know today.\\n\\nIn this letter, John has battled the Gnostics and their insistence upon the need for a “special knowledge”. He concludes it here with his statement that Jesus “has given us understanding” (verse 20). We already know what is true, not because of the reception of a foreign knowledge that has been delivered to us apart from Christ, but because of Jesus’s work on the cross that revealed the fullest extent of God’s glory.\\n\\nIn this letter, John has also battled the false believers who did not live as those who were truly of the Way. He concludes it here with his declaration that those who know Him who is true are also in Him. Those who live as if they do not have Christ in them and are not in Christ themselves do not belong to the Church and do not have eternal life.\\n\\nWe see that verse 20 is essentially a statement that addresses his aforementioned concerns in the Church with the chief solution of Jesus Christ, the Son of God who is “the true God and eternal life” (verse 20).\\n\\nFrom this, we arrive at the last verse of the letter: “Little children, keep yourselves from idols”. It seems to be a command that came out of nowhere, and it seems to be a rather peculiar method of ending the letter. However, if we have read the letter thoroughly, it is also a rather fitting summary of the entire letter as well. \\n\\nYou see, in his entire letter, John attacked many false ideologies and delinquencies of the Church in failing to live as Christ did. He defended the faith against the intruding enemy that sought to pollute the living waters with doctrines that appealed to the sensibilities of man rather than glorify the God Almighty. And we know that another name for those items and philosophies of the world that entertain the man rather than God is “idol”.\\n\\nJohn, when he fights against the heresies and the Church’s lackadaisical attitudes of the time, is not just a tired old man responding to the changing times of the generation with a paranoid eye against the world. No, he is looking at the Church that he suffered so much for and loves so much being bombarded by the ideologies of man that set up man as gods. He is heart-clenchingly writing about the dangers and pitfalls a Christian ought not to behold. He knows that every heresy, every unloving actions of the brothers, and every social movement is but an idol that man creates to elevate the self above God, and John is writing to his “little children” in hopes that they would grow up and recognize the error of their ways.\\n\\nJohn, nearing the end of his life, is writing a letter that speaks clearly of his desire for the Church to flourish without falling to the attacks of the antichrists. John is not being abrupt or brash in his ending the letter with a command. No, he is being urgent in demonstrating his unending, continued love for the Church and desire for the Church to worship Christ of verse 20 and not the idols of their own hearts. Verse 21 seems like an unsatisfying ending to the letter because though the letter has come to an end, John’s heart for the Church and his concern for their misdeeds have not ended.\\n\\nThis is the old man John who is, at the time of writing the letter, perhaps the only apostle left. He is concerned for the Church because he knows that even one step off of the right path that is Christ leads to death, and he is the only one left who was among the twelve. John is writing this letter that they may have eternal life (verse 13) — this world is not the end and he wants his little children to know that.\\n\\nDo we feel this way about the Church? Do you feel broken when the Church chases after the things of this world— replacing Christ with ideologies that are contrary to the Gospel? John did, and we ought to as well.\\n\\nWe live in an age when it is sometimes hard even to distinguish the right from the wrong. We have grown up in a culture that celebrates sin. Looking at the churches that have fallen to the world, let us mourn and lament like we have never done before. This is a cause for lament.\\n\\n\\nConsider\\n\\n1.
