      <h3>Ephesians 1:1-2: Greetings</h3>

      1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
      To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus:

      2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

      *** Please read the verses and pray through it before reading our own takes. ***

      <hr />
      
      In these greetings, we first see how Paul’s identity is established.

      Paul wants to make it clear that he is first and foremost an apostle (meaning messenger or a representative) of Christ. Not only that, but he makes it clear that despite his background (Acts 8:1-3), he has been adopted to God to serve God by the will of God (John 1:12-13).

      Then, Paul goes on to also establish the identity of the church in Ephesus. That is, they are the saints (meaning “the set apart, the holy”), and therefore, they are the ones who are faithful in Christ Jesus. Those who are saints are the ones who can truly be faithful to Christ Jesus, because they are in Christ Jesus.

      So, what does it mean to be in Christ Jesus?

      Just as Christ was faithful to the Father unto death and resurrection — that is, it was His faithfulness that bought us our faith — we can be faithful and holy (“set apart”) because of Christ’s faithfulness. This means that when we adorn Christ and are in Christ, we can also be faithful.

      It is as though we have put on Christ and therefore we no longer wear filthy rags, but now are considered as the perfect righteousness and faithfulness of Christ. Not only that, but we who have been reborn in Christ, those who are grafted into the true vine of Christ, are now a new creation that can produce good fruit (John 15:5).

      And because of this truth, by the co-working of “God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” and the Spirit who proceeded from them to inspire these words that we read, the church has the grace and peace that we so enjoy. We as the saints, as those who are in one body, but perhaps currently in different locations far away — for the recipients of this letter, as far as Ephesus — can say that we are still one and still perfectly held together because of our Father and Lord Jesus Christ. What grace God has given us and what peace we can enjoy in being one with fellow brothers and sisters across the world!

      Wherever you are, brothers and sisters, rejoice and know that Christ is with us even in our separation, loneliness, and chaos, and know that we are together in one spirit.

      Consider

      How have you been faithful saints where you are currently as part of the greater Body?

      How do we have peace even in times of hardship such as the ones you may be going through now?

      It’s sometimes hard to believe everything is by the will of God, but looking through the saints in the Old Testament and the New Testament, how do we see God’s faithfulness? How can you have faith now?
