We will genuinely try to give satisfactory answers! Our aim is not to give a random opinion - we try to provide careful explanations that represent Christian orthodoxy as revealed in Scripture. We also promise to not avoid your questions or shy away from more controversial topics if asked. We would rather you disagree but have a truthful picture of our Christianity than paint a sugar-coated misconception.</p>\n        </div>\n        <h3> How does it work?</h3>\n        <div className=\"about-chat\">\n          <p>Once you make an account, you’ll be able to converse with us. Think of this as a mix between an informal chat and a discussion forum. No need to reply immediately! We want to give you time to think about and process what’s being discussed. Also, as fellow Princeton students, we can’t promise to respond immediately, so conversations will probably be on and off. Remember you can always log back in and check for replies!</p>\n          <p>You have the option to make everything anonymous on your end but will always have access to our contact info. We think this promotes genuine dialogue since you’ll feel comfortable saying whatever is on your mind. Even your username is hashed before we store it in our database. If you lose your username or password, feel free to make a new account!</p>\n        </div>\n        <h3> Who is this chat for?</h3>\n        <div className=\"about-chat\">\n          <p>Anyone can use this chat!
